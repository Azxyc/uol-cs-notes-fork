# Lecture 2-2
## What is Functional Programming?
In a functional programming language **everything is a pure function**.

* The program is built out of pure functions.
* Simple functions are combined to build more complex functions.

This very different style still allows you to do anything you could have done in an imperative language.

## Building Functions
**Every** line is built in the form of:

```haskell
f(x) = <some other function>
```

Functions are built up from other functions:

```haskell
f(x) = square(x) + x
g(x) = h(i(x), j(x))
```

A pure functional program is similar to an imperative language where each subroutine only has one line and immediately returns a value.

## What isn't in Functional Programming?
* Functional programming has no concept of a variable as variables rely on side effects to operate.
* Functional Programming doesn't allow loops. This is because loops need variables to operate. Recursion is used instead.
	* Anything you can do with a loop can also be done with recursion.

* There is no notion of **control flow** as everything is just function application.
	* Control flow is the notion that instructions are followed one at a time in a list.

Functional programming is about passing around your answers.
