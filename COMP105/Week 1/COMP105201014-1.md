# Lecture 3-1
## Functions and Libraries
When using Haskell the default library is Prelude.

Haskell uses special syntax for function calls. E.g. `min` from the Prelude library will work as `min 1 2`. This is as funcions are called as:

```
[function name][space][arg1][space][arg2]...
```

Additionally in Haskell functions bind tighter than mathematical operators:

```H
Prelude> min 28 100/4
7.0
Prelude> min 28 (100/4)
25.0
```

## Two Argument Function Syntax

Functions will two arguments can be infixed by surrounding with back-ticks:

```H
Prelude> mod 10 4
2
Prelude> 10 `mod` 4
2
```

For infix functions like `+` you can surround them with brackets and use them like a prefix function:

```H
Prelude> mod 10 4
2
Prelude> 10 `mod` 4
2
```
