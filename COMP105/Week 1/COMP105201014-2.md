# Lecture 3-2
## Defining Custom Functions

Functions are defined as such:

```
[functionName][arguments][=][body]
```

Functions and arguments must start with small letters as only types use capitals.

They can be written into a file and loaded into ghci or compiled for use in a program. An example of a simple function:

```
addTwo x = x + 2
twoInAddTwo x y = x + y + 2
```

## Loading Functions

* To load a functions from a file run ghci on the file. `~/Documents/COMP105 $ ghci functions.hs` 
* To realod the current file run `:reload` in gchi.
* To load in a file run `:load` and the filepath.

## Comments

Single line comments can be written `-- like this`

Multi-line comments can be written:

```
{- Like
   this-}
```

## Compilation

Instead of running code in the interpreter you can compile it using ghc. To print the output to the `StdOut` you can use the two functions `putStrln(show())` to convert the output to a string and print that to the `StdOut`.

This is part of the IO function-set and won'#t be used again for a while.

## Exercises

1. `double x = 2 * x`
1. `pythagoras a b  = sqrt (a ** 2 + b ** 2)`
	* Must use the float exponentiation operator to allow for floats as a or b.
1. `maxFour a b c d = max (max a b) (max c d)`
