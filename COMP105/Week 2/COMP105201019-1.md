## IF
### Differences Between Imperative and Functional

In imperative languages `if` changes the control flow but in functional languages there is no control flow. 

Functional `if` gives a value that you will return based on a test.

```
if (1==1) then "yes" else "no"
```

Rather than controlling flow, functional `if` chooses between two alternatives and is a pure function.

```
f x = (if x > 10 then 1 else 0) + 2
```

The functional `if` is more commonly known as the **ternary operator** as it has three arguments.

### Things of Note

* For a functional `if` both branches much always be present.
	* A pure function must always return a value.
* Both branches must have the same type.
	* This is because Haskell is strongly typed meaning that a single function can only return values of the same type.
* Nested `if`s are not recommended and there better ways to complete the same task.

### Structure of an IF

```
if A then B else C
```

`A`, `B` or `C` may be anything that can evaluate to a single value. This can be a value itself or another function.

### Exercises

1. `between36 x = if (x > 3 && x < 6) then "yes" else "no"`
1. `min' x y = if x < y then x else y`
1. `max3 x y z = if (x > y && x > z) then x else (if y > z then y else z)`
