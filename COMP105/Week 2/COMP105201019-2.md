# Lecture 4-2
## Let

Sometimes we want to use the same expression more than once:

```
(x * x - 4) + sqrt (x * x - 4)
```

The problem of writing out the same equation over again can be solved using the following example:

```
let s = (x * x - 4) in s + sqrt s
```

### Syntax

```
let <bindings> in <expression>
```

Where:

* `<binding>` gives names to bindings separated by `;`
	* `let a = 1; b = a + 1 in a + b`
* `<expression>` uses those bindings

### Let vs Variables

A let expression doesn't create variables.

* They are names for particular expressions
* You cannot change a binding once it has been made
* They are made for convenience only.

### Let in GHCI

In GHCI you can write:

```
> let a = 1
```

or

```
> a = 1
``` 

To define a let for the rest of the session.

### Let across multiple lines

Usually  it is clearer to write let across multiple lines:

```
f x y = let a = x * x
			b = y * y
		in
			a * a + b * b
```

When splitting across line breaks you don't need to use `;` to separate the bindings.

### Scope

When using let the bindings are only defined within the let function.

### Examples

```
cylinder r h =
	let sideArea = 2 * pi * r * h
		topArea = pi * e ** 2
	in sideArea + 2 * topArea
```

### Exercises

1. `exercise1 x = let a = x * x + 1 in a * a * a`
1. `exercise2 x = let a = x + 1; bb = a + 2; ccc = a + bb in ccc *  ccc`

## Haskell's Layout Rule

Each definition at the same level should start on exactly the same column:

```
f x y z = let
			a = x * x
			b = y * y 
			cc = z * z
		in
			a * b + b * b
```

### Ignoring the Layout Rule

You can ignore the layout rule by using curly braces to separate the bindings.

```
let {a = x * x;
	b = y * y;
	c = z * z}
in
	a + b
```
