# Lecture 8-2
## List Recursion Examples
In this section we will be re-implementing the built in function for operating on lists.
### take
```h
take' 0 list	= []
take' n []		= []
take' n (x:xs)	= x : take' (n - 1) xs
```
With the two base cases the program will end in one of two ways:

* We take as many items as we asked for.
* We run out of elements to take.

### drop
```
drop' 0 list	= list
drop' n []		= [] 	-- could also be an error
drop' n (x:xs)	= drop' (n - 1) xs
```

### elem
```h
elem' e [] = False
elem' e (x:xs)
	| e == x = True
	| otherwise = elem' e xs
```
This will cycle through every item in the list and will stop and say `True` if it is found. If it isn't found then it will return `False`.

This also implements pattern matching and guards in one function.

### maximum
Maximum will say which is the largest element in a list.

```
maximum' []	= error "Called with empty list." 
-- This prints an error with this label
maximum' [x] = x 
-- This pattern matches against a list of length 1.
maximum' (x:xs) =
	let
		max_tail = maximum' xs
	in
		if (x > max_tail) then x else max_tail
```
This checks from the back of the list and keeps the largest element in the list as `x`

### reverse
```
reverse' []		= []
reverse' (x:xs) = reverse' xs ++ [x]
-- ++ puts an element onto the tail of a list
```

## Consuming More Than One Element
### add_adjacent
```h
add_adjacent []			= []
add_adjacent [x]		= error "Odd number of elements"
add_adjacent (x:y:xs)	= x + y : add_adjacent xs
```
```
> add_adjacent [1,2,3,4,5,6]
> [3,7,11]
```

### add_next
```
add_next [] 		= error "Not enough elements"
add_next [_] 		= error "Not enough elements"
add_next [x,y]		= [x+y]
add_next (x:y:xs)	= x + y : add_next (y:xs)
```

## Exercises
```
containsThree [] = False
containsThree (x:xs)
	| x == 3	= True
	| otherwise	= containsThree xs
```
```
sumEvenIdx []		= 0
sumEvenIdx [x]		= x
-- Required to catch 1 and odd element lists.
sumEvenIdx (x:_:xs)	= x + sumEvenIdx xs
```
