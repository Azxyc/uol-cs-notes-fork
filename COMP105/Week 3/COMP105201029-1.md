## `where` Syntax

Sometimes it is useful to bind names across a whole function:
```haskell
remove_twos [] = []
remove_twos (x:xs)
	| x == 2	= rest
	| otherwise = x:rest
	where rest = remove_twos xs
```

As the two expressions are in different guards then you can't use a `let` expression.

A general example is:

```haskell
f x y = 1 + a + b
	where 	a = 2 * x
			b = y / 2
```

`where` comes at the end of a function. Like `let` it can bind any number of names

* These names are available throughout the function.
* They are not variables, of course.

* You an do pattern matching in `where` clauses (and also in `let` expressions too).

An example of pattern matching:

```haskell
initials first last = (x,y)
	where	(x:_) = first
			(y:_) = last
```

## `let` v.s. `where`

`let` is an expression

```haskell
> (let a = 1 in a) + (let a = 2 in a)
> 3
```

`where` is syntax

* One `where` clause per function.
* Particularly useful when used with guards.

```haskell
remove_twos [] = []
remove_twos (x:xs)
	| x == 2	= rest
	| otherwise = x:rest
	where rest = remove_twos xs	
```

This means that where has to be joined to a function body and is always bound to that function body.

## Exercises

1. ```haskell
	func x = a + b + x
		where 	a = 2 * x + 1
				b = a * a - x
	```

1. ```haskell
	countTwos [] 	= 0
	countTwos (x:xs)
		| x == 2	= 1 + rest
		| otherwise = rest
		where rest = countTwos xs
	```
