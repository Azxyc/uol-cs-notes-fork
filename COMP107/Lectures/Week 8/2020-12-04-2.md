## Data
Information encoded in some form.

## Database
A logically coherent collection of data with inherent meaning.
{:.info}

* Collection of related data stored on some physical medium.
* Should be grouped.

### Advantages
* Better control over redundancy.
* Better consistency of data: enforcing integrity.
* Allow independence between data and the mechanism for their usage.
* Enforce a logical conceptualisation of data, leading to a more.
* Users can have a personalised view of data.
* Data sharing is easier, standards may be enforced 
* More efficient storage and search.
* Security can be implemented more easily, e.g. restricting unauthorised access 
* Allow inferences and actions (using “rules”).

### When not to use a Database
* Simple, well-defined database applications not 
expected to change at all.
* Stringent, real-time requirements that may not 
be met because of programming overhead.
* Embedded systems with limited storage.

## Database Management Systems (DBMS)
A DBMS is a collection of programs that enables to create and maintain a database.
{:.info}

Special purpose DBMS:  

* Bespoke set of programs to create and maintain the database needed by one particular application.

General purpose DBMS: 
 
* Software systems that facilitate the management of databases for various applications.

### DBMS Tasks
Define a database: 

* Formally describe the types of data to be stored 

Construct the database:

* Create the physical structure of the database 
* Store actual data on the storage medium, 
controlled by the DBMS (populating the database)

Manipulate the database and provide functions for: 
 
* Querying
* Updating
* Generating reports

## Data Model
A Data Model is a type of data abstraction used to provide a conceptual representation of the data.
{:.info}

* It provides a logical and structured organisation of the data: data is easier to manage, define and
manipulate.
* It allows a separation of physical and logical
organisation of data.

### High Level/Conceptual
Represent “notions”:

* “Classical” models: hierarchical, network and relational
* More recently: object-oriented and functional data models

### Low Level/Physical
Represent the way data are physically stored:

* In traditional file processing these are hard-coded, so any changes in the structure of a file may require changing the programs that access the file.
* A mechanism to describe the high level data model separately means that program and data become independent.

### Components
#### Rules
Describe the structure and the meaning of data:

* For high level data models: definitions of data types, relationships, constraints.
* For low level data models: definitions of file and record formats.

#### Operations
Describe what may be performed on the data:

* For high level data models: definitions of types of retrievals and updates.
* For low level data models: record orderings and access paths (structures that perform the physical search on DB storage).

## Architecture
These characteristics can be summarised into an architecture, that is an abstract design describing how a generic database system should look like.

### ANSI/SPARC Architecture
The ANSI/SPARC architecture is divided into three levels. At each level, the database is described differently:

* The description of a database is called the database schema.
* Each schema is specified in a particular data model.
* The actual data in the database at a particular moment in time is called a database instance (or state, or snapshot).

#### Internal Level
Describes the physical storage of the database.

We don't need to know this one.
{:.error}

* SCHEMA USED: internal schema describing
details of data storage and their access paths.
* DATA MODEL: physical.

#### Conceptual Level
Describes the structure of the whole database for its community of users:

* SCHEMA USED: conceptual schema, describing
all stored data and how it is related (global view).
* DATA MODEL: high level.

#### External Level
Describes the database as seen by each group of its users:

* SCHEMA USED: a number of external schemas,
one for each user to represent, hiding what that
user is not interested in or has no access to.
* DATA MODEL: high level.

## View
A view is a user's perspective. Like designing a database from the view of the person who is going to use it.

* The idea is to re-define the database from different
perspectives.
* A perspective or view, of the database, could.
* Contain subsets of the database.
* Contain virtual data, derived from the database files,
but not explicitly stored.
    * Derived attributes, but also derived relationships!

### 3-Schema Architecture

## Data Independence
Capacity to change the schema at one level of a database system without having to change the schema at the next higher level.
{:.info}

The ANSI/SPARC 3 level schema supports two types of data independence:

### Logical Data Independence
The capacity to change the conceptual schema without having to change external schema (and the applications using it).

* Adding extra personal details to the lecturers is still of no interest to the students, so the students’ view can remain unchanged.

### Physical Data Independence 
The capacity to change the internal schema without having to change conceptual (or external) schema.

* Changing the way the physical files are stored, (to improve efficiency, to distribute them in several locations, etc.)
* Does not change the way in which users “see” the database, so the conceptual level can remain unchanged.
