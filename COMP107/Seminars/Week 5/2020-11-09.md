Introducing assignment 4.
## Activities
* Identification of Application areas and users groups
* Analysis of existing documentation of application areas
* Analysis of current operating environments and the planned use of the information
	* Information flow
	* Types of transactions
* Responses to user questionnaires are analysed.

As a result you should start form a place of a poorly structured set of requirements. You should use a technique to move to a more structured document.

## Glossary

One way to rewrite the specification is to construct a glossary of terms. This will provide:

| Term | Definition | Synonyms |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Purpose of Assignment 2
The purpose of Assignment 2 is to analyse the data present in Assignment 1 to create the structure of a database.

* You should work in groups to complete the data model.
* You will proceed by view aggregation, producing one ER model (or EER if appropriate) conceptualising the view for each of at least 3 user categories you have identified. 
	* Aim at creating 4 to 5 user stories for each user.
	* You will then design the relations tables which map the ER model.

## Deliverable. 
You will produce a PDF document with your report.
