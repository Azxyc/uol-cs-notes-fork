# Tutorial 1 
In this tutorial the first main focus was the group project. 

## User Stories
You might want to use user stories or define user personas:

* As a... *[which type of user has this need?]*
* I need... *[what does the user want to do?]*
* So that... *[why does the user want to do this?]*
* When... *[what triggers the user's need?]*
* Because... *[what does the user need?]*

### Task
In groups, define three user stories for a conference planner app:

* Comic-con, etc.

### User
#### Speaker
As a speaker I need to share slides, knowledge and interact with attendees. This is so that I can present to the attendees throughout the conference because I want to answer user questions and share knowledge.
