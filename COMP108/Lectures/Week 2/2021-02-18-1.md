title: COMP108 - Arrays - Sequential Search
tags: COMP108 Lectures
---
For arrays, out of bounds means any index that is not in the range of the index.

When using arrays in pseudo code the following notation will be used:

```
arrayName[index]
```

Arrays in the notes will also be indexed from 1.

## Sequential/Linear Search
### Input
$n$ numbers stored in an array `A[1..n]`, and a traget number `key`.

### Output
Determine if `key` is in the array or not.

### Algorithm

1. From `i = 1`, coparte `key` with `A[i]` one by one as long as `i <= n`.
1. Stop and report `"Found"` when `key` is the same as `A[i]`.
1. Repeat and report `"Not Found"` when `i > n`.

### Example

| *12* | 34 | 2 | 9 | 7 | 5 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| *7* | | | | | |

| 12 | *34* | 2 | 9 | 7 | 5 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|  | *7* | | | | |

| 12 | 34 | *2* | 9 | 7 | 5 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| | |  *7* | | | |

| 12 | 34 | 2 | *9* | 7 | 5 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|  | | | *7* | | |

| 12 | *34 | 2 | 9 | *7* | 5 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|  | | | |*7*| |

**Found**

### Pseudo Code

```
i = 1
found = false
while i <= n AND found == false
begin
	if A[i] == key then
		found = true
	else
		i = i + 1	// Don't increment if number is found to save i.
end
if found == true then
	output "Found"
else
	output "Not Found"
```

### Time Complexity
How many comparisons does this algorithm take?

* Best case:
	* The best case is where the `key` is the first element in the list.
	* $O(1)$
* Worst case:
	* The worst case is where the `key` is not in the array or the `key` is the last number.
	* $O(n)$
