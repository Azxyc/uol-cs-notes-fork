## Insertion
### Insertion to Head of List

```
List-Insert-Head(L,node)
	node.next = head
	node.prev = NIL
	if head =/= NIL then
		head.prev = node
	else // list was empty
		tail = node
	head = node
```

### Insertion to Tail of List

```
List-Insert-Tail(L,node)
	node.next = NIL
	node.prev = tail
	if tail =/= NIL then
		tail.next = node
	else // list was empty
		head = node
	tail = node
```

### Insertion in Middle
Suppose we want to insert a node after a node pointed to by `curr`.

```
# assume that curr is pointing to a node
List-Insert(L,curr,node)
	node.next = curr.next
	node.prev = curr
	curr.next.prev = node # points to new position from old next
	curr.next = node # point to new position from prev
```

This will not work if `curr` is at any end.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of:

* **inserting** to the **head/tail** of **doubly** linked list is $O(1)$.
* **inserting** to the **head** of **singly** linked list is $O(1)$.
* **inserting** to the **tail** of **singly** linked list is $O(n)$.
	* You may have to traverse the list if you don't have an extra pointer for the last element in the list. If you do then it is $O(1)$
* **inserting** in a sorted **doubly** linked list is $O(n)$.
	* You have to search through the entire list in the worst case. The insertion is only $O(1)$.
