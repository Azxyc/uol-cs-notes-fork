## Deletion from the Head of the List
Consider a list `15, 10, 20`. We want to remove `15` and return it to the user.

```
List-Delete-Head(L)
	node = head
	if node =/= NIL then
	begin  // list wasn't empty
		head = head.next
		if head =/= NIL then
			head.prev = NIL
		node.next = NIL
	end
	return node
```

## Deletion from the Tail of the List
Consider a list `15, 10, 20`. We want to remove `20` and return it to the user.

```
List-Delete-Tail(L)
	node = tail
	if tail =/= NIL then
	begin // list wasn't empty
		tail = tail.prev
		tail.next = NIL
		node.prev = NIL
	end
	return node
```

## Deletion from the Middle
Consider a list `15, 10, 20`. We want to delete a node pointed to by `curr` and return the value.

```
// Assume that curr is pointing to a node
List-Delete(L, curr)
	curr.next.prev = curr.next
	curr.prev.next = curr.next
	curr.next = NIL
	curr.prev = NIL
	return curr
```
