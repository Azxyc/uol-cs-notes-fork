## Binomial Coefficients
The quantity $C(n,k)$, which gives the number of $k$-combinations of a set of size $n$, is called a binomial coefficient.

It is also written as:

$${n\choose k}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$$

This notation is preferred.

### Binomial Theorem
For every natural number $n$:

$$(a+b)^n=\sum^n_{k=0}{n\choose k}a^kb^{n-k}$$

This is the sum of a generic binomial expansion.

### Pascal's Triangle
The choose notation directly relates to pascals triangle. For a generic expansion the row is the power and the value is the coefficient of the related position in the expansion.

### Binomial Coefficient Identity

$${n+1\choose r+1}={n\choose r}+{n\choose r+1}$$

Proof:

* ${n+1\choose r+1}$ is the number of ways to choose a subset of size $r+1$ form a st of size $n+1$.
* Suppose the set is $\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{n+1}\}$.
* How many subsets include $x_{x+1}$? We just choose a size-$r$ subset from $\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{n+1}\}$, so there are $n\choose r+1$ ways to do it.
* These outcomes are disjoint, so the total number of subsets is the sum of $n\choose r$ and $n\choose r+1$.

## Counting and Probabilities
Counting also helps us to answer questions like:

* What are the odds of winning the National Lottery?
* What payoffs should you expect?
* What is more likely in poker, full house or 4-of-a-kind?
