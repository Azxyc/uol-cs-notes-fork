All the relations we have been looking at so far have been binary relations however this can be generalised for greater numbered relations.

## $n$-ary Relations
The Cartesian product $A_1\times A_2\times \ldots \times A_n$ of sets $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n$ is defined by:

$$A_1\times A_2\times \ldots \times A_n=\{(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\ \vert\ a_1\in A_1,\ldots,a_n\in A_n\}$$

Here $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)=(b_1,\ldots,b_n$ if and only if $a_i=b_i$ for all $1\leq i\leq n$.

An $n$-ary relation is a subset of $A_1\times\ldots A_n$

### Databases and Relations
A database table $\approx$ relation.

#### Table 1 $\text{Students}$

| Student_name | ID_number | Major | GPA |
| :-- | :-: | :-- | :-: |
| Ackermann | 231455 | Computer Science | 3.88 |
| Adams | 888323 | Physics | 3.45 |
| Chou | 102147 | Computer Science | 3.49 |
| Goodfriend | 453876 | Mathematics | 3.45 |
| Rao | 678543 | Mathematics | 3.9 |
| Stevens | 786576 | Psychology | 2.99 |

This student table is a subset of the Cartesian product of four sets containing names, ID numbers, subject and GPA. We can then write these properties in tuples in the subset:

$$\text{Students}=\{\text{(Ackerman, 231455, Computer Science, 3.88)}\ldots\}$$

## Unary Relations
Unary relation are just subsets of a set.

### Example
The unary relation $\text{EvenPositiveIntegers}$ on the set $\Bbb{Z^+}$ of positive integers is:

$$\{x\in\Bbb{Z^+}\ \vert\ x \text{ is even}\}$$

This shows that a unary relation is just a list of items in a set the satisfy a property.
