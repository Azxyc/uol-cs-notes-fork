## Truth Values
Interpretations are a way of assigning values to propositions which may vary depending on the situation or person who answers them.

An interpretation $I$ is a function which assigns to any atomic proposition $p_i$ a truth value:

$$I(p_i)\in \{0,1\}$$

* If $I(p_i)=1$, then $p_i$ is called **true** under the interpretation $I$.
* If $I(p_i)=0$, then $p_i$ is called **false** under the interpretation $I$.

Given an assignment $I$ we can compute the truth value of compute formulas step by step using so-called truth tables.

### Implication

The implication $(P\Rightarrow Q)$ of $P$  and $Q$:
 $$\text{If } P \text{ then } Q$$
 
#### Truth Table

| $P$ | $Q$ | $(P\Rightarrow Q)$ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |  
| 0 | 0 | 1 |

Consider this table with the proposition $P$ being a promise. If you don't make a promise but you fulfil it anyway then you aren't breaking that promise.

Another example would be the following statement:

* If a number is divisible by 6 then it is divisible by 3. 
    * If it is not divisible by 6 but still divides by 3, this does not invalidate the proposition.
