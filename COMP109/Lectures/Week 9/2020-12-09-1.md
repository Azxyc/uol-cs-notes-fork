## Number Systems
To indicate that a number of from a particular base system then use a subscript to denote this:

* $4268_{10}$
* $1100\ 0111_2$

In a positional system you should multiply each digit by its place value:

* $4268_{10}=4\times 10^3+2\times 10^2+6\times 10^1 +8\times 10^0$

### Convert Decimal to Binary
The rule is to repeatedly divide by 2, writing down the remainder from each stage from right to left.

#### Example

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{533}{2}&=266r1&
\frac{266}{2}&=133r0&
\frac{133}{2}&=66r1&
\frac{66}{2}&=33r0&
\frac{33}{2}&=16r1\\
\frac{16}{2}&=8r0&
\frac{8}{2}&=4r0&
\frac{4}{2}&=2r0&
\frac{2}{2}&=1r0&
\frac{1}{2}&=0r1
\end{aligned}
$$

You will read this from bottom to top, right to left.

Therefore:

$$533_{10}=1000010101_2$$

#### Alternative Method
If you know the powers of 2, continually subtract largest power value from the number.

This is the method that I usually use. The other method is best suited to a programmatic implementation.

### Binary Addition

#### Half Adder
This adder can add one bit only.

| $P$ | $Q$ | Carry | Sum |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

#### Full Adder
This adder can be linked together to add any number of bits together.

| $P$ | $Q$ | $C_{\text{in}}$ | $C_{\text{out}}$ | $S$ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

### Black Box Notation
To save drawing out all of the gates every time you can draw the diagram as a package. There is also a symbol for an adder:

#### 4-bit Adder

To complete the following calculation:

$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
&a_3&a_2&a_1&a_0\\
+&b_3&b_2&b_1&b_0\\
\hline
c&s_3&s_2&s_1&s_0
\end{array}
$$

You would use the following circuit:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP109/Lectures/2020-12-09-1-4.svg)

If the carry out from this is non-zero then there has been an overflow and the value is larger than you can provide space for.

This is an example of a combinatorial circuit.

### Computer Representation of Negative Integers

Typically a fixed number of bits is used to represent integers:

* Unsigned integers can take up all space.
* Signed Integers
	* Leading Sign
		* Uses the first bit to denote being negative.
		* This can store negative zero which is not desired.
	* Two's Complement
		* Given a positive integer $a$, the two's complement of $a$, relative to a fixed bit length $n$, is the binary representation of:
		
			$$2^n-a$$
			
		* You can view this as flipping the bits.

#### Two's Complement

The two's complement of $a=3$ is:

$$2^4-3=13=1101_2=-3_{10}$$

The bonus of two's complement is that $-1_{10}=1111_2$ will roll over to 0 when you add 1 to it. This also means that there is no two's complement of zero as it is an overflow. This is good as we don't want negative zero.

#### Properties

* Positive numbers start with 0, negative numbers start with 1.
* 0 is always represented as a string of zeros.
* -1 is always represented as a string of ones.
* The number range is split unevenly between $+ve$ and $-ve$ numbers (If 0 is positive then is is even).
* The range of numbers we can represent in $n$ bits is $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1}-1$.

#### Addition & Subtraction
You can add any negative number in order to take it. Generally any carry that goes off the end can be ignored.

#### Overflow
If Both inputs to an addition have the same sign, and the output sign is different, an overflow has occurred.

Overflow cannot occur if inputs have opposite sign.
{:.info}

#### Two's Complement & Bit Negation
Take the example of $n=4$:

* $s^4-a=((2^4-1)-a)+1$
* The binary representation of $(2^4-1)$ is $1111_2$.
* Subtracting a 4-bit number $a$ from $1111_2$ just switches all the 0's in $a$ to 1's and all the 1's to 0's.
* So, to compute the two's complement of $a$, **flip the bits and add 1**.

#### Converting to Decimal
To find the decimal representation of the integer with a given two's complement:

* Fint the two's complement of the given two's complement.
* Write the decimal equivalent of the result.

#### 4-bit Subtractor
The following diagram is an implementation of $a-b$ as the sum of $a$ and the two's complement of $b$.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP109/Lectures/2020-12-09-1-5.svg)

This flips the bits of $b$ and adds one via the carry in.

A more automated approach would be the following:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP109/Lectures/2020-12-09-1-5.svg)

The XOR gates flip the bits when `Subtract` is high. Additionally, when `Subtract` is high 1 is added to the carry in.

#### Floating Point Numbers
It is not always possible to express numbers in integer form.

Real, or floating point numbers are used in the computer when:

* The number to be expressed is outside of the integer range of the computer like:

	$$3.6\times 10^{40} \text{ or } 1.6\times 10^{-19}$$
* The number contains a decimal fraction:

	$$123.456=1.23456\times 10^2$$
	
When using floating point numbers the number is writen like in scientific notation.

#### Binary Fractions
Fractions can be represented in base 2:

$$
\begin{aligned}
10.01_2&=1\times 2^1+0\times2^0+0\times2^{-1}+1\times2^{-2}\\
&=1\times2+0+0+1\times0.25\\
&=2.25_{10}
\end{aligned}
$$

This gives a scientific representation of $10.10_2=1.001\times2^1$

In binary, for any non-zero number the leading digit is always 1.
{:.info}

To represent a number in scientific notation:

* The sign of the number.
* The magnitude of the number, known as the **matissa** or **significand**.
* The sign of the exponent
* the magnitude of the **exponent**.

##### Example - 1 Byte

$$S\ EE\ MMMMM$$

* $S$ is the sign of the number.
* $EE$ are the two characters encoding the exponent.
	* Both sign and magnitude.
		
		This is very low precision see the IEE 754 section for the list of precisions.
		{:.info}
 
* $MMMMM$ are five characters for the mantissa.

#### IEEE 754
IEEE standard for floating point arithmetic. This is implemented in many hardware units and stipulates the computer representations of numbers:

* 16 bit **half precision** numbers.
	* 5 for exponent, 11 for mantissa.
* 32 bit **single precision** numbers.
	* 8 for exponent, 24 for mantissa.
* 64 bit **double precision** numbers.
	* 11 for exponent, 53 for mantissa.
* 128 bit **quadrouple precision** numbers.
	* 15 for exponent, 113 for mantissa.
* 16256bit **octouple precision** numbers.
	* 19 for exponent, 237 for mantissa.
	
As numbers are not stored as surds, small rounding error can accumulate if there isn't enough precision.
