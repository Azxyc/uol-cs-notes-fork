# Proving Properties of Programs
Using induction to show that a program is correct.
## Example on a Recursive Function that Generates Factorials
### Proof
By mathematical induction on $n$.

#### Base Case $n=1$
$$g(1)=1=1!$$

#### Inductive Step
Suppose that for some $n=m, g(n)=n!$

Consider $n=m+1$

$g(m+1)$ the code returns $g(m)\times(m+1)$

By induction hypothesis, $g(m)=m!$

So: 
$$g(m)\times(m+1)=m!\times(m+1)=(m+1)!$$
