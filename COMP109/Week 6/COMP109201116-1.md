# Catch-up Session 5
## Power Sets
The power set $\text{Pow}\{A\}$ of a set $A$ is the set of all possible subsets. This includes the null set $\emptyset$ and the full set.

Each set in the power set follows this definition:

$$\{x|x\subseteq A\}$$

### Example
The power set $\text{Pow}\{A\}$ of a set $A=\{1,2\}$ is:

$$\{\emptyset,\{1\},\{2\},\{1,2\}\}$$

For any set $A$:

$$|\text{Pow(A)}|=2^{|A|}$$

Therefore: 

$$\{x|x\in\text{Pow}(A)\}=\{\emptyset,\ldots\}$$

## Russell's Paradox
People say that you can define a set just by defining the constraints of the set:

$$\{x\in\mathbb{R}|x<4,x\geq-1\}$$

However statements written in this way are susceptible to paradoxes. For example the following paradox:

Everyone from Crete is a liar. <cite>(Said by a person from Crete)</cite>

### Paradoxes in General
A paradox is a case that when expanded contains a contradiction.

## Avoiding Paradoxes
To avoid paradoxes we should write the set definition in the following way:

$$\{x\in\ldots|\ldots\}$$

This means that the set or value x should be taken from some other set.

They should not be written like this:

$$\{x\ldots|\ldots\}$$

## Venn Diagrams and Set Logic

Draw the following as a Venn diagram: $A\cap (B\cup C)$
