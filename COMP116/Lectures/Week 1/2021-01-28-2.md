Vector spaces allow us to collect together vectors with similar characteristics.

## Basics

We have $U$ - a set of $n$-vectors using $H$:

* e.g. $U$ is the set of all 3-vectors from $\Bbb R$.

The set $U$ defines a vector space if it has two *closure properties*:

1. Adding any two vectors in $U$ produces a vector in $U$.
1. Multiplying any vector in $U$ by a constant in $H$ produces a vector in $U$.

### Formal Definition

Given $U$ - a set of $n$-vectors using $H$. The set $U$ defines a vector space if:
$$
\begin{align}
\forall v\in U, \forall w\in U &:v+w\in U &\text{(C1)}\\
\forall v\in U, \forall \alpha\in H &: \alpha v\in U &\text{(C2)}
\end{align}
$$

The underlying set $H$ is very important.

### Examples

1. $\text{EVEN}=\{\langle x,y \rangle:x+y=2p,p\in\Bbb Z\}$

	If $H=\Bbb Z_k$ then $\text{EVEN}$ is a vector space.
	
	If $H=\Bbb R$ then $\text{EVEN}$ is not a vector space.
	
	* Consider C2 using $\lang1,1\rang,\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$.
	
2. \text{ODD}=\{\lang x,y\rang:x+y=2p-1,p\in\Bbb Z\}$

	For this $\text{ODD}$ is not a vector space e.g. $H=\Bbb Z _{16}$:

	* $\lang1,4\rang\in\text{ODD},\lang4,1\rang\in\text{ODD}$
	* $\lang5,5\rang\notin\text{ODD}$

## Attributes

Suppose $U$ is a vector space of $n$-vectors from $\Bbb R$. Important notions are a *basis set* and its *dimension*.

The idea of basis allows us to reduce $U$, even if it is infinite, to at most $n$ distinct vectors. We do this by expressing members of $U$ as linear combinations of other vectors in $U$.

### Linear Combinations

Take a set $B$ of $m$ vectors from $U$:

$$B=\{t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_m\}$$

Take a collection $\vec a$ of $m$ values at least one of which is not 0 and all non-zero values are from $H$.

$$\vec a=\lang\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_m\rang$$

$\vec w$ is a linear combination of $B$ using $\vec a$ is $\vec w$ is:

$$\sum^m_{k=1}\alpha_kt_k$$

### Linear Dependence & Independence

Now suppose that $U$ is a vector space and $B$ is a subset of $k$ $n$-vectors from $U$ for which any $w$ in $U$ can be obtained as a linear combination of $B$?

That is:

$$\forall w\in U\exists\lang\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_k\rang:w=\sum^k_{i=1}\alpha_ib_i$$

Then only $B$ is needed to capture $U$.

## Basis and Dimension

A subset $B$ of $U$ for which any vector in the vector space $U$ can be formed as a linear combination of $B$ is called a **basis** of $U$.

The number of vectors in the smallest basis of $U$ is called the **dimension** of $U$ denoted $\text{dim}(U)$.

A vector space $U$ of $n$-vectors have a dimension of at most $n$.

### Example

$$\text{EVEN}=\{\langle x,y \rangle:x+y=2p,p\in\Bbb Z\}$$

We saw that this was a vector space for $H=\Bbb Z_4$.

It contains:

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}
	\lang0,0\rang, & \lang0,2\rang, & \lang1,1\rang, & \lang1,3\rang,\\
	\lang2,0\rang, & \lang2,2\rang, & \lang3,1\rang, & \lang3,3\rang
\end{array}
\right\}
$$

$\text{dim(EVEN)}=2;B=\{\lang0,2\rang,\lang3,1\rang\}$

e.g. $\lang1,1\rang=1*\lang0,2\rang+3*\lang3,1\rang$
