## Iterated Function Sequences
Let $f:\Bbb C\rightarrow \Bbb C$ be some complex valued function.

The $n^{\text{th}}$ iterate of $f$, denoted by $f_(n)$, when applied to $z\in\Bbb C$ is the complex number, denoted by $z_n$, that results by applying $f$ repeatedly (to the initial value $z_0$). Thus:

$$
f_{(n)}(z)=\begin{cases}z & \text{if }n=0\\f\left(f_{n-1}(z)\right)&\text{if }n>0\end{cases}
$$

### Escape Radius
The complex plane ca be divided into **two disjoint parts** relative to some parameter $r$ called the **escape radius** of $f$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{in}(f)&=\{z\in\Bbb C:\forall n\vert f_{(n)}(z)\vert\leq r\}\\
\text{out}(f)&=\{z\in\Bbb C:\exists k\vert f_{(f)}(z)\vert>r\}
\end{aligned}
$$

The escape radius can often be set as $r=2$.

### Orbits
An orbit is a sequence that loops back on itself:

$$f(z_k)=z_0;f(z_j)=z_{j+1}\forall 0\leq j<k$$

### Popular Sets
Interesting patters are generally of the form:

$$f(z)=z^2+c;c\in\Bbb C$$

The **Mandelbrot Set** classifies those $c$ for which:

$$\vert f_{(n)}(0)\vert\leq 2;\forall n\geq0$$

If $c$ is fixed the subset (using radius 2) $\text{in}(z^2+c)$ is called a **Julia Set** while the set $\text{out}(z^2+c)$ is called the **Fatou Set**.


#### Computing and Displaying Sets
Iterating a fixed number of times gives a good enough approximation.

The colour mapping of these sets often represent the number of times required to iterate before a point exceeds the escape radius.

#### Fractal Dimension
In Euclidean dimension, the dimension is based on whole numbers. Fractal sets have a dimension that is in the rationals ($\Bbb Q$).
