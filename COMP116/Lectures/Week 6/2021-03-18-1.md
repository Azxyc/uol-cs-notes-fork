This is the method that we use to draw trends from experimental data. This is better than a table as it makes the data clearer.

```chart
{
	type: scatter,
	data: {
		datasets: {
			data: [
				{x: 1.5,
				y: 1.2},
				{x: 2.4,
				y: 1.5},
				{x: 3.6,
				y: 1.9},
				{x: 4.2,
				y: 2.0},
				{x: 4.8,
				y: 2.2},
				{x: 5.7,
				y: 2.4},
				{x: 6.3,
				y: 2.5},
				{x: 7.9,
				y: 2.8}
			]
		}
	}
}
```
