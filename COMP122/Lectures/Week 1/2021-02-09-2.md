Java can be thought of as a sequence of statements with each statement ending with a semi-colon.

## Comments
Everything after a double slash `// is a comment.`

Multi-line comments start with:

```java
/*
and end in
*/
```

## Blocks
Statements surrounded by curly brackets form a block. Blocks can be nested.

## Example

```java
/*
Author: Ben
The HelloWorld class implements an application that prints out "Hello World".
*/
public class HelloWorld {

	// Main Method
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}
```

The large block is a class definition which is named `HelloWorld`.

The `main` block is an actionable member of that class.

The class name must be the same as the name of the source code file in which it is defined (but with the extension `.java`

### Java Keywords
There are some words that are reserved for the compiler can cannot be used for tother purposes such as variable names.

### Main Methods
`HelloWorld` has only one method called `main`.

* A class with a `main` method like this is called the **application class**.
* The `main` method is the entry point of the application, from which the JVM begins the execution of the program. 

## Capitalisation and Indentation

* Java is case sensitive so `main` is different to `Main`.
* Indentation carries no meaning. The lines are ended by `;`.

### Code Conventions

* Identifiers use `CamelCase`. Class names start in capitals; method and variable names in small letters.
* Indent your code when nesting.
*  Add comments to explain what your code does.
