Java is strongly typed. This means that all types consist of a **value** and a **type**.

## Types of Types
There are two different types of type in Java.

### Primitive

* `int`, `byte`, `short` and `long`
* `float`, and `double`
* `char`
* `boolean`

### Composite

* `string`
* Arrays e.g. `int[]`

## Literals
Literal values are the actual value of some type that occurs.

* 0 or 574489 are literals of type `int`
* `true` and `false` are literals of type `boolean`
