A variable is a named memory location that can be changed during the program's execution. It has three properties:

1. A type.
1. A value.
1. A name or identifier.

## Identifiers
Not all identifiers are valid. They **can** be an sequence of alphanumeric characters, `$` and `_` unless:

* They start with a number.
* It is a **keyword**.

Identifiers are case sensitive.

### Conventions

* Class names start in capital letters.
* Method and variable names start in lower case letters.
* CamelCase is used if several words make up and identifier.

### Example
In the following code all of the following keywords are identifiers:

`HelloWorld`, `main`, `String`, `args`, `System`, `out` and `println`.

```
public class HelloWorld {

	// Main Method
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(*"Hello World");
	}
}
```

## Variable Declarations
A **declaration statement** declares a variable to be of a particular type and is of the form:

```
<type> <variableName>;
```

where `<type>` is a type and `<variableName>` a legal identifier.

```
double currentWeight;
int studentsLearningJava;
int maximumValue;
```

Variables must be declared before you can use them.

## Variable Assignments
An **assignment statement** stores a value in a variable as follows:

```
<variableName> = <value>;
```

* `<variableName>` may be any already declared identifier.
* `<value>` is a value of the same type as `<variableName>`.

### Declaration and Initialisation
We can also combine declaration a variable with the assignment of an initial value (initialisation) as follows:

```
<type> <variableName> = <value>;
```

```
double currentWeight = 122.5;
int studentsLearningJava = 78;
```
