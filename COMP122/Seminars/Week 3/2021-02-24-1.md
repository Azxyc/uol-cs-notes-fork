## Division by Zero in Java
Generally, will give no error and the result `Infinity`.

If you divide 0.0 by 0.0 then you will get the result `NaN`.

## Code Blocks
Indentation is ignored by the compiler. You should use `{}` to properly define your blocks.

### `switch` statements
This can we used as a case select statement.

```java
switch (x) {
	case 0:
	case 1: // code to run
		break; // this will have it stop after the block.
	default: //default code to run
		break;
}
```

The `break` reserved word ceases execution of the `switch` block. The `default` case is not required.

## Inherits from C/C++

```java
int a = 0;
int b = 0;

int c = 12 > 10 ? ++a : b++;	// the ? can be used in place of an if
```

If the condition before `?` is true then the first condition is executed. If false then the condition after `:` is executed.

To increment numbers `++` can be used. There can be two cases:

* `a++`
	* This evaluates to the old value of `a` but increments `a`.
* `++a`
	* This evaluates to the increment of `a` and increments `a`.
	
## A Random Walk Example
### Generating a Random Value of 1/-1

`Math.random()` gives a decimal number in the range $0\leq x<1$.

You can use `Math.floor(x)` to concatenate to integer.

`Math.floor(Math.random())` will give 0 or 1 randomly.

## Assessment 1
This assessment is based around the Caesar Cipher.
