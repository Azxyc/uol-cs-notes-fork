## Using Local Variables
Variables will be declared in the C portion of the code and take up the following amount of space:

* `int` - 4 bytes
* `char` - 1 byte
	* Strings will take as many bytes and characters.
	
### Example of Common Assignments

```c
int num = 0;
signed in num = -2;
char alpha = 'a';
char name[] = "Jo Smith\n";
```

In this example the string must end with `\n` in order to print the next statement on the next line.

`\n` has the decimal value of 10.
