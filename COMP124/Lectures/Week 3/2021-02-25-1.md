title: COMP124 - Calling External Subroutines for I/O
tags: COMP124 Lectures
---
This calls the subroutines from the C libraries to provide I/O functions.

## External Subroutines
In order to call external subroutines from assembly the parameters need to be pushed to the stack.

## `printf`
This function prints to the standards output.

* It expects its parameters to be on the stack.
* It expect the string parameter to be passed by reference.
* It will not remove the parameter from the stack, so you must do it afterwards.

### Assembly Example

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main (void) {
	char msg[] = "Hello World\n"; // declare string in c
	_asm {
		lea eax, msg	; put address of string in eax
		push eax	; stack the parameter
		call printf	; use library function
		pop eax	; take parameter off stack
	}
	return 0;
}
```

### Looping Problem
Suppose we want to print our message 10 times. Then we might try making a standard loop.

The issue is that we don't know what is going on inside the external routine. As a result we have to assume that any registers we are using will be overwritten. 

This means **we must** save register values before the call, and restore them after. This should be done via the stack.

```cpp
	mov ecx, 10	; set up loop counter
loop1:
	push ecx	; save ecx on stack
	lea eax, msg
	push eax	; stack the parameter
	call printf	; use the function
	pop eax	; remove param
	pop ecx ; restore ecx
	loop loop1	; loop based on ecx
```

### Format Specifiers

The string parameter to `printf()` can contain format specifiers.

Each format specifier refers to another parameter, and tell `printf()` how it should be printed.

```cpp
int age = 21; char name[] = "Bob";
printf("My name is %s and my age is %d\n", name, age);
```

This will print:

```
My name is Bob and my age is 21.
```

Some formats:

* `%d` - Print as decimal integer.
* `%s` - Print as string.
* `%c` - Print as character.
* `%f` - Print as floating point.

#### Example
We will do the equivalent of:

```cpp
printf("Number is %d\n", n);
```

We have to pass both paramters:

* The string's address.
* The value of `n`.

These must be paced on the stack in reverse order.

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main (void) {
	char msg[] = "Number is %d\n", n;
	int n = 157;
	
	_asm {
		push n 	; push the int first
		lea eax, msg
		push eax	; now stack the string
		call printf
		add esp, 8 ; clean 8 bytes from stack
	}
	return 0;
}
```

The final instruction cleans the data from the stack without loading each value into eax.

## `scanf`
Reading values from the keyboard can be achieved by using `scanf()`:

```cpp
scanf("%d", &num); // format specifiers for inputs are mandatory
```

We have to tell `scanf()` where to put the item being read. That means passing the address of the variable.

### Example

```cpp
char fmt[] = "%d";
int num;
_asm {
	lea eax, num	; we need to push the address of num
	push eax
	lea eax, fmt	; now the format string
	push eax
	call scanf	; on return the value will be stored
	add esp, 8	; clean stack
	}
```
