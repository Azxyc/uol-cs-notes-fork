## Operating Systems
The purpose of operating systems is to:

* Turn base hardware into a usable machine.
* Make efficient use of available resources, particularly when they are shared.

### Abstract of Components

Everything can talk to every other thing.

All but the UCI are the four essential managers of every OS, each working with the others to perform its task:

* Memory Manager
* Processor Manager
* Device Manager
* File Manager

Network functions were not always an integral part of an OS.

* A Network Manager can be added to handle networking tasks.
* User Command Interface
	* How users interact with the OS by issuing commands.

### Manager Functions
Each subsystem manager must perform the following tasks:

* Continuous monitoring of resources.
* Enforcement of policies that determine who gets what resources, when they get them and how much.
* Allocation of resource when it is appropriate.
* De-allocation of resources when finished.
