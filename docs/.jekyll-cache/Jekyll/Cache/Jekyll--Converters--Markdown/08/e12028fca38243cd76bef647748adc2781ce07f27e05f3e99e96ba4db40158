<h2 id="culture-of-citing">Culture of Citing</h2>
<p>For fiction there might be sources in your work, but these are never acknowledged, unless they serve a literary purpose.</p>

<p>In journalism there must be sources but these are rarely acknowledged. Exceptions may include quotations and for reports. These acknowledgements are not always in a format considered acceptable in academia.</p>

<h2 id="dependency-on-discipline">Dependency on Discipline</h2>
<p>In academic writing all sources that make a contribution to you work must be acknowledged.</p>

<p>Styles can be different from discipline to discipline, for example in philosophy there is a huge amount of referencing. However, in mathematics concepts are often named after the person who made or discovered them or you may use a concept which has very specific wording but you won’t reference in the same way as a philosophy paper.</p>

<h3 id="urls-are-not-enough">URLs are not enough</h3>
<p>This is as they don’t give all the information about a source and may not be valid in the future. URLs are fine when given in addition to other information.</p>

<h3 id="digital-object-identifiers">Digital Object Identifiers</h3>
<p>DOIs are a system of creating a perma-link to a digital reference online. They are preferable over URLS but still they should be given in addition to a conventional reference.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-references">Types of References</h3>
<p>What information is required about  when the work can be obtained depends on it’s type. For example here are references for a book<sup id="fnref:book" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:book" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and a journal paper<sup id="fnref:paper" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:paper" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
