<p>An example of this process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Problem in the real world.</li>
  <li>A plain English description of the input, output and main components.</li>
  <li>Entity Relationship model of the data in a database.</li>
  <li>The definition of the table of a relational database.
    <ul>
      <li>The technical details of the model such as the database format and table definitions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>MySQL or Oracle database.</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of the modelling process is so you can give your design to another person in a team and they know how to implement it.</p>

<h1 id="assignment-1">Assignment 1</h1>
<p>Produce a wiki-style report (between 2000 and 2500 words) introducing an innovative system/application you would like to implement.</p>

<p class="info">This system will not be implemented as you can write the proposal with little concern of whether it it realisable.</p>

<h2 id="things-to-include">Things to include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The domain of the system.
    <ul>
      <li>In which context is it useful?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What makes the solution important?
    <ul>
      <li>Requires references as to why it is an important problem to solve.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What makes it new?
    <ul>
      <li>Research 3 - 5 direct competitors in the market and describe why yours is better.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The purpose of the new system.</li>
  <li>What different categories of users will the system have?
    <ul>
      <li>Envisaging how they will utilise the system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Main benefits and shortcomings of the system and the main obstacles and shortcomings of the system.
    <ul>
      <li>Also the main invectives for uptake of the system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Include a high level description of that data and what the users will use the data for.
    <ul>
      <li>Include a description of each of the user categories you have identified.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Any outside meeting should be recorded on canvas in the form of minutes.</p>
