<h2 id="how-to-we-form-our-knowledge">How to we form our knowledge?</h2>
<p>Generally we form our personal collection of facts from sources that we meet in our every day life. This means that a good proportion of the knowledge we might think that we have is composed of myths. This is especially found in <em>news</em> articles.</p>

<p>These articles are generally based in fact in the sense that they reference real journals. The articles covert the unreadable and specialised format of the journal into a more sensationalised and popularised format.</p>

<h2 id="assessing-the-source">Assessing the Source</h2>
<h3 id="argument-from-expert-opinion">Argument from Expert Opinion</h3>
<p>When assessing arguments from expert opinion the following must be taken into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expertise
    <ul>
      <li>How credible is the source?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Field
    <ul>
      <li>Is the source expert in the field?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Opinion
    <ul>
      <li>What did the source actually say? When?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Trustworthiness
    <ul>
      <li>Is the use of the source reliable or does the writer have any alternator motive where they might not want to portray the data as it was collected?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Consistency
    <ul>
      <li>Is the source consistent with others?
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Peer Review</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="main-academic-sources">Main Academic Sources</h2>
<h3 id="scholarly-vs-popular">Scholarly v.s. Popular</h3>
<p>A scholarly paper is a way for expert in the field to communicate their results, typically to other experts in the field.</p>

<p>A popular paper is a communication to the general public about some research. They may not be as rigorous or detailed as a scholarly paper.</p>

<h3 id="conference-papers">Conference Papers</h3>
<p>Gatherings for researchers to present and discuss their work, typically related to a particular academic discipline and often held at regular intervals.</p>

<p>Output published in “conference proceedings” in the form of conference papers written by the researchers about their work, and often peer-reviewed</p>

<p>Types of events:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conference</li>
  <li>Workshop</li>
  <li>Symposium</li>
</ul>

<p>You should check the acceptance ratio to check what people think of the paper.</p>

<h3 id="journal-articles">Journal Articles</h3>
<p>Academic journals are peer-reviewed periodicals in with research relating to a particular academic discipline is published.</p>

<p>Each issue of a journal contains a collection of articles, each article written by a group of researchers.</p>

<p>There may be <em>special issues</em> on a single topic.</p>

<h2 id="dependency-on-discipline">Dependency on Discipline</h2>
<p>Computer Science is a dynamic subject, and communication of results, and publication, <strong>relies heavily on conferences</strong>.</p>

<p>This is compared to other disciplines which focus on publishing in journals.</p>

<h3 id="therefore">Therefore</h3>
<p>A prestigious Computer Science conference has  a very rigorous peer review process. Papers tend to be longer and more exhaustive.</p>

<p>A medical conference, for contrast, will present mainly 300 word abstracts with the intention that a full paper will follow on a journal.</p>

<h2 id="publication-pipeline">Publication Pipeline</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Authors submit paper to conference/journal for peer review.
    <ul>
      <li>At least two peer reviews reading independently.</li>
      <li>For journals, they could have many iterations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If accepted, the paper is revised by the authors and submitted to the conference journal editor.</li>
  <li>The paper is processed to bring it into the publisher’s format (typesetting/layout).</li>
  <li>The paper is then included in the publisher’s database and possibly published in printed form.</li>
  <li>Literature databases collect the bibliographic information from several publishers, and add additional information (references with links, citation index) and link back to publisher for full text of papers.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="publisher-databases-and-search-engines">Publisher Databases and Search Engines</h2>
<p class="info">Have a look at <a href="/UoL/assets/COMP107/Lectures/2020-10-31-1.pdf">the slides</a> for a list of the publishers that the university subscribes to on the library page: <a href="http://liv.ac.uk/library">Discover (UoL)</a>.</p>

<p>If a journal is included in a journal/proceedings database then there has been a review process in order for it to be accepted. This may mean that it is more trustworthy.</p>

<p>Get into the habit of using <a href="scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> to find other papers or number of citations leading to a paper.</p>

<p>The site <a href="arXiv.org">ArXiv.org</a> hosts pre-prints of papers that are moderated but not peer-reviewed. This allows us to get bleeding edge information on very current topics such as COVID-19. They should be taken in context.</p>

<h3 id="dbs-vs-search-engines">DBs v.s. Search Engines</h3>
<p>Literary databases cover a vast number of academic sources but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They do not cover all journals conferences.</li>
  <li>They do not cover books.</li>
  <li>They do not cover workshops and similar scientific meetings.</li>
  <li>They do not cover technical reports and pre-prints.</li>
</ul>

<p>Web search engines provide much better coverage of all types of publications but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Typically also return a lot of irrelevant material to a query.</li>
  <li>Leave it to the user to distinguish high quality form low quality material.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each point you can give a source a score from one to ten. If the score if above 40 then the source is good or excellent. Bellow 30 makes the source problematic as a source of information.</p>
