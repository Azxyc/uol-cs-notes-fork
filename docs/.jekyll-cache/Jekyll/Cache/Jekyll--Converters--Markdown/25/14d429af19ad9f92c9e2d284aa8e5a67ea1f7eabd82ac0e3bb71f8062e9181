<p>Liam, Ravi and Ben Weston were present.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-submission-requirements">Identifying Submission Requirements</h2>
<p>We had a look at the marking criteria to identify the requirements for the report.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify at least three users or view which provide three different perspectives on the model?</li>
  <li>For the user preservatives create 4 - 5 different user stories.</li>
  <li>Group them in a number of iterations.</li>
  <li>Draw out the user stories in an EER diagram. Over various iterations.
    <ul>
      <li>Draw EER diagram for each user story.</li>
      <li>Merge those together into user perspectives</li>
      <li>Merge those together into one EER diagram for the butler.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure to include all EER diagram features in our diagrams to make them as complete as possible.</p>

    <p class="warning">Find out about tableaux testing to check if your design produces spurious records.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Additionally there should be descriptions that tie the EER diagrams together.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="method-of-collaboration">Method of Collaboration</h2>
<p>We should collaborate in a collaborative word document. The link will be in the chat and I will put it <a href="https://theuniversityofliverpool-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/pslrimme_liverpool_ac_uk/EeQ192A2au5BiL3bXaAfThYBg70DZD49EASdD04O2dLZYQ?e=yVUTC8">here</a> too.</p>

<p>We should base our document on the following <a href="https://liverpool.instructure.com/courses/17251/files/1391047/download?wrap=1">template</a>.</p>
