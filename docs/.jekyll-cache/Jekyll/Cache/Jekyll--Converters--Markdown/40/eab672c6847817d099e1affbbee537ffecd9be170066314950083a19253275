<ul>
  <li>Counter Example Method
    <ul>
      <li>Prove that a statement is false by use of a counter-statement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Universal Proof
    <ul>
      <li>Applies to all integers e.g. odd if \(a=2k+1\)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>\[(a+b)^2=a^2+b^2\]</p>

<p>Holds for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some integers</li>
  <li>All integers</li>
  <li>No integers</li>
</ul>

<p>The answer is that it holds for some integers as when \(a=0,\ b=0\). \[ (0+0)^2=0^2+0^2\] This also follows for \(a\neq0,\ b=0\).</p>

<p>The two proofs I gave as answers to the question count for both a counter example proof and a universal proof.</p>

<h2 id="example-of-proof-by-contradiction">Example of Proof by Contradiction</h2>
<p>Suppose for a proof by contradiction that \(P_n\) is the largest prime number. Therefore, \(P_1\ldots P_n\) are all the primes.</p>

<p>Consider \(P=P_1\times P_2\ldots P_n+1\)</p>

<p>Case 1: \(P_p\) is prime</p>

<p>Case 2: \(P_p\) not prime. Then \(P\) must have prime member.</p>
