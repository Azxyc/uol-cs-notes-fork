<p>Show that in any group of six people there are either three who all know each other or three complete strangers.</p>

<p><img src="/UoL/assets/COMP109/Lectures/2020-11-13-3-1.png" alt="Graph 1" /></p>

<p>On this graph blue is people who know each other and red is people who donâ€™t. From the graph you can see that only two people will know each other.</p>

<p><img src="/UoL/assets/COMP109/Lectures/2020-11-13-3-2.png" alt="Graph 2" /></p>

<p>What the question is saying is that no matter how you colour this you will always have a triangle of three people with red lines (donâ€™t know) or blue lines (do know).</p>

<h3 id="proof">Proof</h3>
<p>Let $A,B,C,D,E,\underline F$ denote people under consideration.</p>

<p>Construct $f:\{A,B,C,D,E}\rightarrow\{0,1}$ as follows: $f(x)=1$ if $x$ knows $F$, or $0$ else.</p>

<p>This means that we are taking out the person $F$ and considering who they know in a binary format.</p>

<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph TD
subgraph A
A
B
C
D
E
end
subgraph B
0
1
end
</code></pre>

<p>$\vert A\vert =5, \vert B\vert =2$ Therefore there must exist $\{x_1,x_2,x_3}\subseteq\{A,B,C,D,E}$ such that $f(x_1)=f(x_2)=f(x_3)$</p>

<h4 id="case-1">Case 1</h4>
<p>Suppose that $f(x_1)=f(x_2)=f(x_3)=1$. This means that they all know each other.</p>

<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph LR
x1 --&gt; F
x2 --&gt; F
x3 --&gt; F
x2 --&gt;|Case 1.1| x3
x1 .-&gt;|Case 1.2| x2
x2 .-&gt;|Case 1.2| x3
x3 .-&gt;|Case 1.2| x1
</code></pre>
<p><em>Dotted means donâ€™t know.</em></p>

<h5 id="case-11">Case 1.1</h5>
<p>There is a pair who know each other.</p>

<h4 id="case-12">Case 1.2</h4>
<p>There is no pair who know each other.</p>

<p>So $x_1,x_2,x_3$ are complete strangers.</p>

<h3 id="case-2">Case 2</h3>
<p>$f(x_1)=f(x_2)=f(x_3)=0$</p>

<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph LR
x1 .-&gt; F
x2 .-&gt; F
x3 .-&gt; F
x1 --&gt;|Case 2.1| x2
x2 --&gt;|Case 2.1| x3
x3 --&gt;|Case 2.1| x1
x1 .-&gt;|Case 2.2| x2
</code></pre>
<p><em>Dotted means donâ€™t know.</em></p>

<h4 id="case-21">Case 2.1</h4>
<p>$x_1,x_2,x_3$ all know each other.</p>

<h4 id="case-22">Case 2.2</h4>
<p>Three is a pair who donâ€™t know each other.</p>

<p>As you can see in any case there is a triangle of three people with links stating that they know or donâ€™t know each other in any case. This proves the statement. This is as we can see that three know or donâ€™t know each other in any situation.</p>
