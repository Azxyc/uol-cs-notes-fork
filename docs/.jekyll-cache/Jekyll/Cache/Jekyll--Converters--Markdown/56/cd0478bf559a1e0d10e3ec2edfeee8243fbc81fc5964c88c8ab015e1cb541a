<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>

<p>One way to rewrite the specification is to construct a glossary of terms. This will provide:</p>

<p>| Term | Definition | Synonyms |
| â€” | â€” | â€” |</p>

<h2 id="purpose-of-assignment-2">Purpose of Assignment 2</h2>
<p>The purpose of Assignment 2 is to analyse the data present in Assignment 1 to create the structure of a database.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should work in groups to complete the data model.</li>
  <li>You will proceed by view aggregation, producing one ER model (or EER if appropriate) conceptualising the view for each of at least 3 user categories you have identified.
    <ul>
      <li>Aim at creating 4 to 5 user stories for each user.</li>
      <li>You will then design the relations tables which map the ER model.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deliverable">Deliverable.</h2>
<p>You will produce a PDF document with your report.</p>
