<p>You should consider each user perspective separately.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Requirements are given for many users groups or applications independently.</li>
  <li>an ER schema is designed  for each user group and application (typically by different developers.)</li>
  <li>Individual views are merged into a global conceptual schema.</li>
  <li>Individual views can be reconstructed as external schema after view integration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="view-integration">View Integration</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Identification of correspondences and conflicts among schema.
    <ul>
      <li>Need to identify constructs in schemas that represent the same real-world concept.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Modification of views to conform to one another.
    <ul>
      <li>Some of the view schemas may need to be refined to resolve conflicts identified in 1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Merging of views.
    <ul>
      <li>Global schema is created by merging individual schemas.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Restructuring.
    <ul>
      <li>Global schema may require further refinement to remove redundancies or unnecessary complexity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<ol>
  <li>In the example we put up all the diagrams next to each other to view the conflicts. They include:
    <ul>
      <li>Names (including synonyms).
        <ul>
          <li>Homonyms - Using the same name for different things.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Notions
        <ul>
          <li>Where concepts are represented as entities or attributes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>From this you change each view individually to make them coherent with each other.</li>
  <li>After this you eliminate redundancies to make them into a single diagram.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="task">Task</h3>
<p>Draw and ER or EER model to describe a library by using a view integration approach.</p>

<p>The group made this in the first phase:</p>

<p class="warning">We should stick very specifically to the story. Over-designing is bad for other people’s designs and you should stick to only the points in your story.</p>

<p class="error">The subject of the user story <strong>does not</strong> need to be included in the diagram. This is because they are the user and don’t need data stored about them to use the database.</p>

<p>The group made this in the second phase.</p>

<p><img src="/UoL/assets/COMP107/Tutorials/2020-11-27-1-2.svg" alt="1st Phase" /></p>

<p class="error">Attributes should not be shared between different entities.</p>

<p class="error">The attribute course should be an entity and not a complex attribute. This would make a student enrolled in many courses.</p>
