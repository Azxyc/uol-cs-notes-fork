<p>An existential statement is a statement in the form: 
\(\exists x\ Q(x)\)
This means that there exists a value to which the function $Q(x)$ holds true. This may be under additional parameters.</p>

<p>The easiest way to prove this is to find an $x$ that makes the function $Q(x)$ true. Not all can be proved this way.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<ol>
  <li>$\exists$ an even integer $n$ that can be written in two ways as a sum of two prime numbers. 
 \(10=5+5=7+3\)</li>
  <li>There $\exists$ integers $m$ and $n$ such that $m&gt;1$, $n&gt;1$ and $\frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n}$ is an integer.
 \(m=n=2\)
     Giving an example is a suitable proof.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="proving-universal-statements">Proving Universal Statements</h2>
<p>Generally proofs will require you to answer a universal statement rather than an existential one. an existential statement is of the form:
\(\forall x \text{ if } P(x) \text{ then } Q(x)\)
This means that for all of $x$ if one function is applied to $x$ another function in $x$ also holds true. For example:</p>

<p>@figure
If $a$ and $b$ are integers then $6a^2b$ is even.
@/</p>

<p>In this statement the “$a$ and $b$ are integers” count for $P(x)$ and “$6a^2b$ is even” counts for $Q(x)$.</p>

<p>@figure
$6a^2b$<br />
$2(3a^2b)$
@/</p>

<p>By halving you are proving that the answer is even as it is a multiple of two.</p>

<h3 id="proof-by-exhaustion">Proof by Exhaustion</h3>
<p>For theorems examining a relatively small number of examples you can test each value to see if the statement holds true. That is proof by exhaustion.</p>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Prove that $(n+1)^3 \geq 3^n$ if $n$ is a positive number.</li>
</ul>

<p>As this theorem has such a small scope then each value can be tested to see if it is correct.</p>

<h3 id="generalising-from-the-generic-particular">Generalising from the Generic Particular</h3>
<p>This method allows for using algebra and known rules to prove a statement generally.</p>

<h4 id="method">Method</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Express the statement to be provided in the form $\forall x,\text{ if } P(x) \text{ then } Q(x)$</li>
  <li>Start the proof by supposing $x$ is a particular by arbitrarily chosen element for which the hypothesis $P(x)$ is true.</li>
  <li>Show that the conclusion $Q(x)$ is true by using definitions, previously established results, and the rules for logical inference.</li>
</ul>

@/</p>

<h3 id="example-1">Example</h3>
<p>Prove that the sum of any two even integers is even.</p>

<ol>
  <li>(Assume that/Suppose that) $m$ and $n$ are particular but arbitrarily chosen even integers.</li>
  <li>As we assumed that $m$ is an even integer, $m = 2k$ for some integer $k$.</li>
  <li>Likewise $n$ is an even integer, $n = 2l$, for some integer $l$
    <ul>
      <li>We cannot use the same letter again as $k$ has already been used</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Then $m+n=2k+2l=2(k+l)$, which is even as $k+l$ is an integer.</li>
</ol>

<p>The final step is called the conjecture as is aided by the previous steps to explain why the conjecture holds true.</p>

<h3 id="disproving-universal-statement-by-counterexample">Disproving Universal Statement by Counterexample</h3>
<p>To disprove a statement means to show that it is false. For example, for a statement such as:
\(\forall x \text{ if } P(x) \text{ then } Q(x)\)
You are saying that the opposite is true:
\(\exists x \text{ such that } P(x) \text{ and not } Q(x)\)</p>

<p>This means that you must give at least one example that disproves the universal statement.</p>

<h4 id="example-2">Example</h4>
<p>Is it true that for every positive integer $n,n^2\geq 2n$?</p>

<p>No as for $n=1,\ n^2 = 1$ and $2n=2$ which is greater than $n^2$</p>

<hr />
<p>@figure
You can correct this by stipulating that for ever integer greater than one the statement holds true.
