<p>A set $B$ is called a subset of a set $A$ if every element of $B$ is an element of $A$. This is denoted by $B\subseteq A$.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>\(\{3,4,5\}\subseteq\{1,5,4,2,1,3\},\ \{3,3,5\}\subseteq\{3,5\},\ \{5,3\}\subseteq\{3,5\}\)</p>

Therefore, $\forall$ sets $A$, $A\subseteq A$
@/
â€”</p>

<p>Furthermore, $\emptyset\subseteq A$ is always true. This is as the empty set is always a subset of any other set including the empty set itself.</p>

<h4 id="subsets-in-python">Subsets in Python</h4>
<p>In programming languages such as python you can save on writing out a function to fund whether a set is a subset of another set. To do this you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;</code> symbol in place of the $\subseteq$ symbol:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">m</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> are both sets.</p>

<h3 id="subsets-and-bit-vectors-example">Subsets and Bit Vectors Example</h3>
<p>Let $S=\langle1,2,3,4,5\rangle,A={1,3,5}$ and $B={3,4}$.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is $A\subseteq B$?</p>

    <p>$x_a=[1,0,1,0,1]$<br />
  $x_b=[0,0,1,1,0]$</p>

    <p>Therefore $A\nsubseteq B$. As you can see from the aligned bits. Not all the bits present in $x_b$ are present in $x_a$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the set $C$, represented by $[1,0,0,0,1]$, a subset  of the set $D$, represented by $[1,1,0,0,1]$?</p>

    <p>$C\subseteq D$ as all bits present in the bit vector of $C$ are also present in the bit vector of $D$.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="equality">Equality</h2>
<p>As covered before a set $A$ is called equal to a set $B$ if $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq A$. This is denoted by $A=B$.</p>

<p>This is to say that if two sets are subsets of each other then they are equal.</p>

<h3 id="confirming-equality">Confirming Equality</h3>
<p>Let $S=\langle1,2,3,4,5\rangle,A={1,3,5}$ and $B={3,4}$.</p>

<h4 id="is-ab">Is $A=B$?</h4>
<p>$x_a=[1,0,1,0,1]$<br />
$x_b=[0,0,1,1,0]$</p>

<p>Therefore $A\neq B$ as the bit vectors do not match.</p>
