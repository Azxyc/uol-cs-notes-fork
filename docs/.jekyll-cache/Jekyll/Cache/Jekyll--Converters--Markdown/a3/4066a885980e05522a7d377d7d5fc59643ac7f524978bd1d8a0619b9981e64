<p>The cardinality of a finite set is the number of element in the set. Sets \(A\) and \(B\) have the same cardinality \(\Rightarrow\) there is a bijection from \(A\) to \(B\).</p>

<p>Let \(S=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}\) and let \(B^n\) be the set of bit strings of length \(n\). The function:</p>

<p>\[f:\text{Pow}(S)\rightarrow B^n\]</p>

<p>assigns each subset \(A\) of \(S\) to its characteristic vector is a bijection.</p>

<p>We used this to compute the cardinality of the powerset.</p>

<h3 id="infinite-sets">Infinite Sets</h3>
<p>Sets \(A\) and \(B\) have the <strong>same cardinality</strong> iff there is a <strong>bijection</strong> from \(A\) to \(B\).</p>

<p>\(S=\{n\in\mathbb{Z}\vert n\text{ is even}\}\)</p>

<p>\(f:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow S\)</p>

<p>\(f(n)=2n\)</p>

<p>\(f\) is a bijection</p>

<p>This is by the definition of bijection as the function maps one to one.</p>

<p>\(\mathbb{N}\) and \(\mathbb{Z}\)</p>

<p>Consider a hotel with rooms and a train with people having the cardinality \(\in \mathbb{N^+}\). Each person in the train is given a unique room.</p>

<p>A second train arrives with the same properties. Consider that people in train one are given odd rooms and people in train two are given even rooms.</p>

<p>The relation between the cardinality of the hotel and the two trains:</p>

<p>\(f:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}\)</p>

<p>\[f(n) = \begin{cases}2n,&amp; \text{if } n\geq 0\\ -2n-1,&amp; \text{if }n&lt;0\end{cases}\]</p>

<p>This proves that there is a bijection between the two sets \(\mathbb{Z}\) (the integers) and \(\mathbb{N}\) (natural numbers).</p>

<p>This graph shows that there is a one to one mapping of the numbers between 0 and 1 to all real numbers. This is becuse for all values for x between 0 and one all real numbers are produced on the y axis.</p>
