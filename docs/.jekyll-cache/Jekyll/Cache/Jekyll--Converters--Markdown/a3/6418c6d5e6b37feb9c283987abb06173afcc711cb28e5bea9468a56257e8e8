<h3 id="types-of-numbers">Types of Numbers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ are whole numbers that start from 0.</li>
  <li>Integers are whole numbers including negatives.</li>
  <li>Rational numbers are any number that can be represented as fractions without a denominator of 0.</li>
  <li>Real numbers are any decimal number that can be presented on a number line. E.g. $\pi$</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="proofs">Proofs</h3>
<p>A mathematical proof is a carefully reasoned argument to convince a sceptical listener that a statement is true.</p>

<h2 id="properties-of-odd-and-even-numbers">Properties of Odd and Even Numbers</h2>
<p>An even number $m$ is in the form $m = 2k$ where $k$ is an integer.</p>

<p>An odd number $n$ is in the form $n= 2l+1$ where $l$ is an integer.</p>

<h3 id="notation">Notation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The symbol $\exists$ means exists.</li>
  <li>The symbol $\Leftrightarrow$ means if and only if.</li>
  <li>The symbol $\forall$ means for all.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some definitions written in notation may look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>$n$ is even $\Leftrightarrow \exists$  an integer $k$ such that $n=2k$</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>$n$ is odd $\Leftrightarrow \exists$  an integer $k$ such that $n=2k+1$</p>
  </li>
</ul>
