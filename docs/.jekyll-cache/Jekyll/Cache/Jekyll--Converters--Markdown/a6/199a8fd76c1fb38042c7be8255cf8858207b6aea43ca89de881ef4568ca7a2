<p>Introducing assignment 4.</p>
<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Identification of Application areas and users groups</li>
  <li>Analysis of existing documentation of application areas</li>
  <li>Analysis of current operating environments and the planned use of the information
    <ul>
      <li>Information flow</li>
      <li>Types of transactions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Responses to user questionnaires are analysed.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result you should start form a place of a poorly structured set of requirements. You should use a technique to move to a more structured document.</p>

<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>

<p>One way to rewrite the specification is to construct a glossary of terms. This will provide:</p>

<p>| Term | Definition | Synonyms |
| — | — | — |</p>

<h2 id="purpose-of-assignment-2">Purpose of Assignment 2</h2>
<p>The purpose of Assignment 2 is to analyse the data present in Assignment 1 to create the structure of a database.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should work in groups to complete the data model.</li>
  <li>You will proceed by view aggregation, producing one ER model (or EER if appropriate) conceptualising the view for each of at least 3 user categories you have identified.
    <ul>
      <li>Aim at creating 4 to 5 user stories for each user.</li>
      <li>You will then design the relations tables which map the ER model.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deliverable">Deliverable.</h2>
<p>You will produce a PDF document with your report.</p>

<h1 id="comp107---seminar-3"><a href="/UoL/comp107/seminars/2020/10/26/1.html">COMP107 - Seminar 3</a></h1>
<p>The seminar opened with a catch-up of the lectures that had been released during the week including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Systems Development Life-Cycle</li>
  <li>Requirement Elicitation
    <ul>
      <li>Gathering information from people.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>
<p>An overview of the assignment requirements and materials provided.</p>

<ul>
  <li>More effort should be put into accrediting team members in the meeting minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modelling-process">Modelling Process</h2>

<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph LR
A[Real World Problem] --&gt; B[Information Model]
B --&gt; C[Conceptual Model]
C --&gt; D[Logical Model]
D --&gt; E[Physical Model]
</code></pre>

<p>An example of this process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Problem in the real world.</li>
  <li>A plain English description of the input, output and main components.</li>
  <li>Entity Relationship model of the data in a database.</li>
  <li>The definition of the table of a relational database.
    <ul>
      <li>The technical details of the model such as the database format and table definitions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>MySQL or Oracle database.</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of the modelling process is so you can give your design to another person in a team and they know how to implement it.</p>

<h1 id="assignment-1">Assignment 1</h1>
<p>Produce a wiki-style report (between 2000 and 2500 words) introducing an innovative system/application you would like to implement.</p>

<hr />

<p>@figure
This system will not be implemented as you can write the proposal with little concern of whether it it realisable.

<h2 id="things-to-include">Things to include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The domain of the system.
    <ul>
      <li>In which context is it useful?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What makes the solution important?
    <ul>
      <li>Requires references as to why it is an important problem to solve.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What makes it new?
    <ul>
      <li>Research 3 - 5 direct competitors in the market and describe why yours is better.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The purpose of the new system.</li>
  <li>What different categories of users will the system have?
    <ul>
      <li>Envisaging how they will utilise the system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Main benefits and shortcomings of the system and the main obstacles and shortcomings of the system.
    <ul>
      <li>Also the main invectives for uptake of the system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Include a high level description of that data and what the users will use the data for.
    <ul>
      <li>Include a description of each of the user categories you have identified.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Any outside meeting should be recorded on canvas in the form of minutes.</p>
