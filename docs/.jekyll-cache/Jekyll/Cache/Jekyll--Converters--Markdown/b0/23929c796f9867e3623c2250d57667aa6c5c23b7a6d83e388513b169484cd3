<p>This type of modelling is inspired by agile principles.</p>

<h2 id="designing-an-er-schema">Designing an ER Schema</h2>
<p>You should identify the basic components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entity types.</li>
  <li>Relationship types.</li>
  <li>Attributes</li>
  <li>And for each of these components:
    <ul>
      <li>Key attributes (unique for each identity).</li>
      <li>Cardinality and participation constraints of relationships.</li>
      <li>Different entity types.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="strategies-to-er-design">Strategies to ER Design</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Top-down
    <ul>
      <li>Start with a schema containing high-level abstractions an apply successive top-down refinements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bottom-up
    <ul>
      <li>Start with a schema containing basic abstractions then proceed by combining and adding to these.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Inside-out
    <ul>
      <li>Start from a central set of concepts, that are most evident and spread outwards,  by considering new concepts in the vicinity of existing ones.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="evolutionary-data-modelling">Evolutionary Data Modelling</h2>
<p>This is an approach that proceeds in an incremental manner.</p>

<ul>
  <li>An initial <strong>slim</strong> model is created that satisfies some initial requirements.</li>
  <li>The model is then refines in a set of iterations, adding details.</li>
</ul>

<p>At each iteration a database can be built with a set of functionalities, queries, interface…</p>

<ul>
  <li>We will ignore this and only discuss data modelling.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="agile">Agile?</h3>
<p>Agile data modelling is evolutionary data modelling done in a collaborative manner.</p>

<p class="info">Agile is a set of principles, not a specific technique.</p>

<p>You can decide whether you want to apply evolutionary modelling in a highly collaborative setting or in a traditional development setting.</p>

<h3 id="user-stories">User Stories</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Primary tolls of agile programming strategies.</li>
  <li>They are a very high level and very concise statement of a requirement.</li>
  <li>Much much smaller than a use case.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<p>Students can only enrol in a module if it is included in their programme.</p>

<p class="info">As they are so short you should have many in order to make the system.</p>

<h4 id="creating-a-story-set">Creating a Story Set</h4>
<p>You can collect them informally or use a template. You should collect them systematically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Number them.</li>
  <li>Order them.</li>
  <li>Prioritise them.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="template">Template</h4>
<ul>
  <li>As a (role) I want (something) to  that (benefit).</li>
  <li>Similar format to the tutorial:
    <ul>
      <li>As a..</li>
      <li>I need/want/expect to…</li>
      <li>So that…</li>
      <li>When…</li>
      <li>Because… (is the user constrained by any circumstances)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Collect, order and prioritise your user stories.</li>
  <li>Decide how many iteration you want to make.</li>
  <li>Decide which new stories you want to include in the design at each iteration.</li>
  <li>Proceed to create an Entity Relationship model that represents those user stories.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="general-criterial-for-design">General Criterial for Design</h3>
<ol>
  <li>If a concept has a significant amount of properties it is an <strong>entity</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>It’s existence doesn’t depend from other concepts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If a concept has a simple structure or refers to another concept then it is an <strong>attriute</strong>.</li>
  <li>If the requirements contain a verb or connector then it is a <strong>relationship.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="example-1">Example</h3>
<p>Consider the following script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 We wish to create a system for a company that runs training courses.
2 For each course participant, identified by a code, we want to store the
3 national insurance number, surname, age, sex, place of birth,
4 employer’s name, address and telephone number, previous employers
5 (and period employed), the course attended and the final assessment
6 of each course. We need also to represent the seminars that each
7 participant is attending at present and, for each day, the places and
8 times the classes are held. Each course has a code and a title and any
9 course can be given any number of times. Each time a course is given,
10 we call it an “edition” of the course. For each edition, we represent
11 the start and end dates and the number of participants. If a trainee is
12 a self employed professional, we need to know his or her area of
13 expertise, and, if appropriate, his or her title. For somebody who
14 works for a company we store the level and position held. For each
15 instructor we will show surname, age, place of birth, the edition the
16 course is taught, those taught in the past and the courses the tutor is
17 qualified to teach. All the instructor’s telephone numbers are also
18 stored. An instructor can be permanently employed or freelance.

<p>This type of diagram may not result in the most efficient database. You may want to make changes from this conceptualisation when implementing.</p>

<h4 id="dodgy-entities"><em>Dodgy</em> Entities</h4>
<p>Some entities such as trainee, professional and edition aren’t true entities. They are a type of entity called a <strong>weak entity</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="weak-entities">Weak Entities</h2>
<p>These are entities which cannot be identified in isolation. Instances are identified because they belong to specific entities from another entity type, known as <strong>identifying owner</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The content of a lecture theatre - whiteboards, desks - cannot be typically identified directly.
    <ul>
      <li>The lecture theatre is their identifying owner, so we can talk about: the front desk in the Ashton Lecture Theatre.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="info">Weak entities are entities that have an owner.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The relationship type that relates the weak entity to its owner is the weak entity’s <strong>identifying relationship</strong>.</li>
  <li>Weak entity types might have a partial key, to distinguish one weak entity fro other weak entities related to the same owner.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="weak-entities-vs-total-participation">Weak Entities v.s. Total Participation</h3>
<p>A weak entity cannot exist in isolation, it must have an owner. This means that is is often confused with a total participation relationship.</p>

<h4 id="total-participation">Total Participation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A lecturer <em>must</em> work for a department.
    <ul>
      <li>The lecturer is not a weak entity as they have a staff number and can be identified.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="weak-entity">Weak Entity</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A desk <em>must</em> belong to a lecture theatre.
    <ul>
      <li>This is weak as we don’t have a direct ID for the desk.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="er-notation">ER Notation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A weak entity is represented as a double box.</li>
  <li>The identifying relation is a double diamond.</li>
  <li>A partial key has a dotted underline.</li>
</ul>

<p class="info">View <a href="/UoL/assets/COMP107/Lectures/2020-11-22-1.pdf">the slides</a> for the final diagram including this new notation. This also includes notation for multi-attributes. There is also a further example from the textbook.</p>

<h4 id="alternate-cardinality-notation">Alternate Cardinality Notation.</h4>
<p>Instead of using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> to denote the cardinality of a relationship you can have finer control by stating the range of cardinalities allowed like so:</p>

<h1 id="comp107---basic-definitions-in-the-er-model"><a href="/UoL/comp107/lectures/2020/11/18/1.html">COMP107 - Basic Definitions in the ER Model</a></h1>
<p>The entity relationship model is used to express the conceptual schema of a database. It was originally proposed in 1976 as a means to unify the network and relational DB models.</p>

<p>Many theoretical extensions and practical applications have been developed including the <strong>Enhanced Entity Relationship (EER)</strong> model.</p>

<p>It is simple enough to learn and understand the basic concepts and powerful enough to be used in the development of complex applications.</p>

<p>Conceptual designs using the ER model are called <strong>ER Schemas</strong></p>

<h2 id="er-model-components">ER Model Components</h2>
<p>The ER model describes data in terms of three primitive notions.</p>

<h3 id="entities">Entities</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An entity is a thing, which can be distinctly identified.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="attributes">Attributes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A property of an entity.</li>
  <li>They are common properties that are shared by all instances of the entity type.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="complexity-of-attributes">Complexity of Attributes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Complex attributes have structure.
    <ul>
      <li>Dates</li>
      <li>Addresses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Simple attributes only have one component.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cardinality">Cardinality</h4>
<p>Some attributes may have more than one value. If this is the case then you can say that a particular value has a cardinality $&gt;0$.</p>

<h4 id="primitiveness">Primitiveness</h4>
<p>A primitive attribute is any attribute which will be stored as data in the system.</p>

<p>A non-primitive, or derived attribute, can be calculated from other attributes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In some cases it is important that both attributes are indicated on the model
    <ul>
      <li>We should indicate which ones are redundant so that they can be derived.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="relationships">Relationships</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An association among entities.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="degree-of-relationships">Degree of Relationships</h4>
<p>A relationship has a degree that is the number of participating entity types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Binary relationship (degree two).
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>person</strong> owns a <strong>car</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ternary relationships (degree three).
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>lecturer</strong> teaches a <strong>course</strong> to a <strong>student</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="attributes-of-relationships">Attributes of Relationships</h4>
<p>Relationships can have attributes in the case that the attribute is not of an entity but when it is related to the relationship.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the relationship type, “person owns a car” the attribute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date of purchase</code> is not an attribute of a person and is not an attribute of the car, it is an attribute of the ownership.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="structural-constrains-on-relationships">Structural Constrains on Relationships</h4>
<p>Relationship constraints regulate the possible combinations of entities that can participate in a relationship:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can constrain the number of entities that can participate.</li>
  <li>We can put a constraint on whether some entities must participate.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="relationship-participation">Relationship Participation</h5>
<p>A participation constraint specifies whether an entity must be in the given relationship.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>total participation constraint</strong>, indicates that each instance of an entity must be in that relationship.
    <ul>
      <li>A programme must belong to a department.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>partial participation constraint</strong> specifies that there may exist an entity which does not participate in the relationship.
    <ul>
      <li>Not all lecturers supervise students.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cardinality-of-relationships">Cardinality of Relationships</h4>
<ul>
  <li>One to One
    <ul>
      <li>One department only has one head.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>One to Many
    <ul>
      <li>Each team can have many players but one player can only play for one team.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Many to Many
    <ul>
      <li>A student can be registered for many courses and a course will have may students.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="er-diagram-basics">ER Diagram Basics</h2>
<p>Entity types are represented as boxes:</p>

<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph TD

</code></pre>

<p>Relationship types are represented as diamonds connected with each participating entity type. The relationship must have a name.</p>

<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph TD
a{works_in}
</code></pre>

<p>Attributes are shown as ovals connected to the relevant entity or relation type. In addition key attributes are underlined.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The key attribute should only be underlined if it arises naturally. If not there should be a key put in later in implementation.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph TD

<h1 id="comp107---how-to-cite"><a href="/UoL/comp107/lectures/2020/10/31/3.html">COMP107 - How to Cite</a></h1>
<p>Referencing is a description that identifies an information source, whereas citation is the use of a reference in text.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is not a good practice to simply list all your references at the end of a document without a connection.</li>
  <li>Need to clearly mark what is your own work and what is the work of others.</li>
  <li>Need to help readers get more information on what they are interested in.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stylistic-choices">Stylistic Choices</h2>
<p>You should place citations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Before the punctuation mark (<cite>Smith,1994</cite>).</li>
  <li>At a logical place (<cite>Smith,1994</cite>) in the sentence.</li>
  <li>At a grammatically correct place in a sentence:<br />
According to <cite>Smith (1994)</cite>, there are 50 billion neurons in the human brain.</li>
  <li>Before a list of items:<br />
There are five categories of users <cite>(Anderson, 2008)</cite>: Students, teachers, professors, technical staff, administrative staff.</li>
  <li>Following quotations:<br />
“This is a really cool quotation.” <cite>(Guy, That, 1994, p. 345)</cite></li>
</ul>

<p class="info">There are examples of correct and incorrect cases on the slides</p>

<h2 id="bibliography-style">Bibliography Style</h2>
<p>A bibliography style determines how the citations and references are presented.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ordinal Number</strong></p>

    <p>Sources listed in the bibliography are sorted according to some ordering, typically based on the authors; names, and numbered consecutively.</p>

    <p>Citations in the text are given as lists of numbers coss-referencing the bibliography, enclosed in square brackets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Author-Date</strong></p>

    <p>Sources in the reference list are arranged alphabetically by the authors’ surnames.</p>

    <p>Work by the same authors are arranged by year of publication, starting with the earliest.</p>

    <p>More than one work with the same authors and date, a letter is added to the year of publication to distinguish them.</p>

    <p>The year of the publication typically immediately follows the list of authors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abbreviation</strong></p>

    <p>Mix of ordinal number style and author-date style.</p>

    <p>Sources in the bibliography are presented like in ordinal number style, but instead of numbering them, each source is given an unique identifier based on authors’ names and year of publication, with additional letter to disambiguate duplicate abbreviations.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="info">Examples of all of these and best practices are given in the slides.</p>

<h1 id="comp107---how-to-reference"><a href="/UoL/comp107/lectures/2020/10/31/2.html">COMP107 - How to Reference</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of referencing is to show how work extends the current state-of-the-art knowledge in the area, proof originality of work, give credit to other people’s work, support and validate arguments made and demonstrate familiarity with work done in the area.</p>

<h2 id="culture-of-citing">Culture of Citing</h2>
<p>For fiction there might be sources in your work, but these are never acknowledged, unless they serve a literary purpose.</p>

<p>In journalism there must be sources but these are rarely acknowledged. Exceptions may include quotations and for reports. These acknowledgements are not always in a format considered acceptable in academia.</p>

<h2 id="dependency-on-discipline">Dependency on Discipline</h2>
<p>In academic writing all sources that make a contribution to you work must be acknowledged.</p>

<p>Styles can be different from discipline to discipline, for example in philosophy there is a huge amount of referencing. However, in mathematics concepts are often named after the person who made or discovered them or you may use a concept which has very specific wording but you won’t reference in the same way as a philosophy paper.</p>

<h2 id="rules-of-thumb">Rules of Thumb</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you use words or ideas from any documents, even produced by yourself, then the source must be cited.</li>
  <li>If you gain words or ideas through conversation, written or spoken, the the source must be cited.</li>
  <li>If you use the exact words from any medium it must not only be cited but also indicated as a quotation. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">""</code></li>
  <li>If you reproduce any material then the source must be cited.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="no-citation-is-required-for">No Citation is Required for:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Your own experiences that have not been published before.</li>
  <li>You are writing about your own work that have not been published before.</li>
  <li>You are reusing your own materials.</li>
  <li>You are using common knowledge or generally accepted facts.</li>
  <li>In the context of student submission, if you use facts but not exact words form recommended textbooks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-refer-to-a-source">How to Refer to a Source</h2>
<p>Just by looking at the reference a knowledgeable reader must collect all information about the source. You should also have an idea about the type of a source from the structure.</p>

<p class="info">Refer to the slides for the types of source.</p>

<h3 id="urls-are-not-enough">URLs are not enough</h3>
<p>This is as they don’t give all the information about a source and may not be valid in the future. URLs are fine when given in addition to other information.</p>

<h3 id="digital-object-identifiers">Digital Object Identifiers</h3>
<p>DOIs are a system of creating a perma-link to a digital reference online. They are preferable over URLS but still they should be given in addition to a conventional reference.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-references">Types of References</h3>
<p>What information is required about  when the work can be obtained depends on it’s type. For example here are references for a book<sup id="fnref:book" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:book" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and a journal paper<sup id="fnref:paper" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:paper" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-we-form-our-knowledge">How to we form our knowledge?</h2>
<p>Generally we form our personal collection of facts from sources that we meet in our every day life. This means that a good proportion of the knowledge we might think that we have is composed of myths. This is especially found in <em>news</em> articles.</p>

<p>These articles are generally based in fact in the sense that they reference real journals. The articles covert the unreadable and specialised format of the journal into a more sensationalised and popularised format.</p>

<h3 id="argument-from-expert-opinion">Argument from Expert Opinion</h3>
<p>When assessing arguments from expert opinion the following must be taken into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expertise
    <ul>
      <li>How credible is the source?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Field
    <ul>
      <li>Is the source expert in the field?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Opinion
    <ul>
      <li>What did the source actually say? When?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Trustworthiness
    <ul>
      <li>Is the use of the source reliable or does the writer have any alternator motive where they might not want to portray the data as it was collected?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Consistency
    <ul>
      <li>Is the source consistent with others?
        <ul>

<h2 id="main-academic-sources">Main Academic Sources</h2>
<h3 id="scholarly-vs-popular">Scholarly v.s. Popular</h3>
<p>A scholarly paper is a way for expert in the field to communicate their results, typically to other experts in the field.</p>

<p>A popular paper is a communication to the general public about some research. They may not be as rigorous or detailed as a scholarly paper.</p>

<h3 id="conference-papers">Conference Papers</h3>
<p>Gatherings for researchers to present and discuss their work, typically related to a particular academic discipline and often held at regular intervals.</p>

<p>Output published in “conference proceedings” in the form of conference papers written by the researchers about their work, and often peer-reviewed</p>

<p>Types of events:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conference</li>
  <li>Workshop</li>
  <li>Symposium</li>
</ul>

<p>You should check the acceptance ratio to check what people think of the paper.</p>

<h3 id="journal-articles">Journal Articles</h3>
<p>Academic journals are peer-reviewed periodicals in with research relating to a particular academic discipline is published.</p>

<p>Each issue of a journal contains a collection of articles, each article written by a group of researchers.</p>

<p>There may be <em>special issues</em> on a single topic.</p>

<h2 id="dependency-on-discipline">Dependency on Discipline</h2>
<p>Computer Science is a dynamic subject, and communication of results, and publication, <strong>relies heavily on conferences</strong>.</p>

<p>This is compared to other disciplines which focus on publishing in journals.</p>

<h3 id="therefore">Therefore</h3>
<p>A prestigious Computer Science conference has  a very rigorous peer review process. Papers tend to be longer and more exhaustive.</p>

<p>A medical conference, for contrast, will present mainly 300 word abstracts with the intention that a full paper will follow on a journal.</p>

<h2 id="publication-pipeline">Publication Pipeline</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Authors submit paper to conference/journal for peer review.
    <ul>
      <li>At least two peer reviews reading independently.</li>
      <li>For journals, they could have many iterations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If accepted, the paper is revised by the authors and submitted to the conference journal editor.</li>
  <li>The paper is processed to bring it into the publisher’s format (typesetting/layout).</li>
  <li>The paper is then included in the publisher’s database and possibly published in printed form.</li>
  <li>Literature databases collect the bibliographic information from several publishers, and add additional information (references with links, citation index) and link back to publisher for full text of papers.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="publisher-databases-and-search-engines">Publisher Databases and Search Engines</h2>
<p class="info">Have a look at <a href="/UoL/assets/COMP107/Lectures/2020-10-31-1.pdf">the slides</a> for a list of the publishers that the university subscribes to on the library page: <a href="http://liv.ac.uk/library">Discover (UoL)</a>.</p>

<p>If a journal is included in a journal/proceedings database then there has been a review process in order for it to be accepted. This may mean that it is more trustworthy.</p>

<p>Get into the habit of using <a href="scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> to find other papers or number of citations leading to a paper.</p>

<p>The site <a href="arXiv.org">ArXiv.org</a> hosts pre-prints of papers that are moderated but not peer-reviewed. This allows us to get bleeding edge information on very current topics such as COVID-19. They should be taken in context.</p>

<h3 id="dbs-vs-search-engines">DBs v.s. Search Engines</h3>
<p>Literary databases cover a vast number of academic sources but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They do not cover all journals conferences.</li>
  <li>They do not cover books.</li>
  <li>They do not cover workshops and similar scientific meetings.</li>
  <li>They do not cover technical reports and pre-prints.</li>
</ul>

<p>Web search engines provide much better coverage of all types of publications but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Typically also return a lot of irrelevant material to a query.</li>
  <li>Leave it to the user to distinguish high quality form low quality material.</li>
</ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For each point you can give a source a score from one to ten. If the score if above 40 then the source is good or excellent. Bellow 30 makes the source problematic as a source of information.</p>

<p>When eliciting from people you should take into account who you want to talk to. There should be adequate stakeholders to get comprehensive coverage. There should be selection based on role, position, decision power, usage, expertise, exposure to problems, interests and influence on uptake.</p>

<p>Interviewing can also be difficult as there may be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conflicting points of view.</li>
  <li>Different backgrounds, culture, terminology.</li>
  <li>Different languages, jargon, hidden knowledge.</li>
  <li>Internal politics and dynamics.</li>

<h2 id="data-gathering-techniques">Data Gathering Techniques</h2>

<p class="info">For a grid of data gathering techniques and their pros and cons view <a href="/UoL/assets/COMP107/Lectures/2020-10-24-1.pdf">the slides</a> for this lecture.</p>

<p>User stories could apply to all three methods. These are anecdotal stories in the workplace that apply to the issue. Enduring stories capture all aspect of the organisation and are  the ones a systems analysts should be looking for.</p>

<p>Stories can be used to <strong>validate</strong> the companies decision, <strong>explain</strong> why the company acted in a certain way, describe an <strong>experience</strong> or <strong>prescribe</strong> the listener how to act. They can be used to complement other methods.</p>

<p>The main methods to gather information are:</p>

<h3 id="questionnaires">Questionnaires</h3>
<ul>
  <li>They are useful in gathering form <strong>key users</strong> or potential users. They can collect information on:
    <ul>
      <li>Attitudes</li>
      <li>Beliefs</li>
      <li>Behaviours</li>
      <li>Characteristics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interviewing">Interviewing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>They are painful as they need to be planned. The following should be considered:
    <ul>
      <li>Dispersion of organisation members.</li>
      <li>Number of members.</li>
      <li>Exploratory work required.</li>
      <li>Problem solving prior to the interviews.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Interviewing is an important method of collecting data on human and system information requirements. They reveal information about:
    <ul>
      <li>Opinions</li>
      <li>Feelings</li>
      <li>Goals</li>
      <li>Key user experience concerns.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Due to the instant nature of interviews there should be some preparation for the interview.
    <ul>
      <li>Reading background material.</li>
      <li>Establishing interview objectives.</li>
      <li>Deciding whom to interview.</li>
      <li>Preparing the interviewee.</li>
      <li>Deciding on question types and structure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A pyramid or funnel method should be used in interviewing questions. You should start with a very general question and add more details to get to the source of the problem.</li>
  <li>Reports should be written as soon a possible after the interview so that as much detail is retained as possible. Two people can take notes to compare later.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="joint-application-design">Joint application design</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Involving the users from the start in the design of the system.</li>
  <li>The users will develop a greater link to the system. This will make the system more useful to them.</li>
  <li>You should consider if the issue meets the following requirements before using this method:
    <ul>
      <li>Users want something new and bespoke.</li>
      <li>The organisational culture supports joint problem solving behaviours and allows leave to participate in the exercise.</li>
      <li>The analyst reckons that many more ideas will be generated using JAD than with one-to-one sessions.</li>
      <li>The analyst should also be trained in the technique.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>People involved:
    <ul>
      <li>Executive sponsor</li>
      <li>System analyst</li>
      <li>Users</li>
      <li>Session leaders</li>
      <li>Observers</li>
      <li>Scribe</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Benefits of JAD:
    <ul>
      <li>Time is saved, compared with traditional interviewing.</li>
      <li>Rapid development of systems.</li>
      <li>Creative idea production is improved.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Drawbacks of JAD:
    <ul>
      <li>It requires a large block of time to be available for all session participants.</li>
      <li>If preparation or the follow-up report is incomplete the session may not be successful.</li>
      <li>The organisational skills and culture may not be conducive to a JAD session.</li>
