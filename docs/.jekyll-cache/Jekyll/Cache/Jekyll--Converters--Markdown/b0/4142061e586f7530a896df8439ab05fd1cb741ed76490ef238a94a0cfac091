<h4 id="proof">Proof</h4>
<p>Assume for a proof by contradiction that there is a greatest prime number $P_n$.</p>

<p>Then $P_1, P_2, \ldots , P_n$ are all prime numbers.</p>

<p>Consider $P=P_1\times P_2\times \ldots \times P_{n+1}$</p>

<p>Consider cases:</p>

<h5 id="case-1">Case 1</h5>
<p>$P=P_1\times P_2\times \ldots \times P_{n+1}$ is prime. As $P&gt;P_n$ we derive a contradiction.</p>

<h5 id="case-2">Case 2</h5>
<p>$P$ is not a prime. Then $P$ has a divisor (all numbers can be expressed as a product of primes).</p>

<p>Then $P$ has a prime factor.</p>

<p>So one of $P_1, P_2, \ldots , P_n$ must divide $P$. This number can be called $P_i$.</p>

<p>$P=P_i\times Q,\ Q\neq 1$</p>

<p>$P_1\times\ldots P_{n+1}=P_i\times Q$</p>

<p>$P_1\times\ldots P_{i-1} \times P_i \times P_{i+1} \times\ldots P_{n+1}=P_i\times Q$</p>

<p>$P_i \times Q - P_i (P_1 \times\ldots\times P_{i-1} \times P_{i+1} \times P_n)=1$</p>

<p>$P_i(Q-P_1 \times\ldots\times P_{i-1} \times P_{i+1} \times\ldots\times P_n) = 1$</p>

<p>This is a contradiction as one is not a product of two distinct integers.</p>

<p>As a result the statement that there is no greatest prime number.</p>

<h3 id="prove-that-sqrt2-is-not-a-rational-number">Prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is not a Rational Number</h3>
<p>Assume for a proof by contradiction that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational.</p>

<p>Then there exist integers $m,n$ such that $\sqrt{2}=\frac{m}{n}, n\neq 0, \frac{m}{n}$ is not reducible.</p>

<p>Then $(\sqrt{2})^2=(\frac{m}{n})^2$. Then $2=\frac{m^2}{n^2}$.</p>

<p>Then $2n^2=m^2$. So $m^2$ is even.</p>

<p>We already know that $m$ must be even.</p>

<p>By definition of even $m=2k$ for some integer $k$.</p>

<p>$2n^2=m^2, m=2k$</p>

<p>$2m^2=(2k)^2$. Then $2n^2=4k^2$. Then $n^2=2k^2$, so $n^2$ is even.</p>

<p>Then $n$ is even.</p>

<p>So we derive a contradiction as n and m have a common factor of $2$. As it is reducible it doesnâ€™t follow the rule.</p>

<h2 id="indirect-proof-of-existential-statements">Indirect Proof of Existential Statements</h2>
<p>Prove that there exist irrational numbers $q$ and $r$ such that $q^r$ is rational.</p>

<p>Consider Cases:</p>

<h3 id="case-1-1">Case 1</h3>
<p>If $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is a rational number then we are done and $q=\sqrt2, r=\sqrt2$.</p>

<h3 id="case-2-1">Case 2</h3>
<p>$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is not rational. Then:</p>

<p>$q=\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}, r=\sqrt2$</p>

<p>$q^r = (\sqrt2^{\sqrt2})^{\sqrt2}=\sqrt2^{\sqrt2\sqrt2}=\sqrt2^2=2$</p>
