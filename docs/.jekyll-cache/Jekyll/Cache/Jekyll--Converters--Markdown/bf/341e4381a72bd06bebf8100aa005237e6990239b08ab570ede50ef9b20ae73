<p>The cardinality of a finite set $S$ is the number of elements in $S$.</p>

<p>A bijection $f:S\rightarrow\{1,\ldots,n}$. This means that there are as many elements in the set that $S$ maps to as there are in $S$.</p>

<p>For finite sets $A$ and $B$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\vert A\vert \geq\vert B\vert \Rightarrow$ there is a surjective function from $A$ to $B$.</li>
  <li>$\vert A\vert \leq\vert B\vert \Rightarrow$ there is an injective function from $A$ to $B$.</li>
  <li>$\vert A\vert =\vert B\vert \Rightarrow$ there is a bijection function from $A$ to $B$.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the graph as $\vert A\vert =n=\vert B\vert $ then we can deduce that $g^{-1}\circ f$.</p>

  <li>Bijective means one to one.</li>

  <li>Injective means one to many.</li>

<h2 id="the-pigeonhole-principle">The Pigeonhole Principle</h2>
<p>Let $f:A\rightarrow B$ be a function where $A$ and $B$ are finite sets.</p>

<p>The pigeonhole principle states that if $\vert A\vert &gt;\vert B\vert $ then at least one value of $f$ occurs more than once.</p>

<p>In other words, we have $f(a)=f(b)$ for some distinct elements $a,b$ of $A$.</p>

<p>The principle is if $(N+1)$ pigeons occupy $N$ holes, then some hole must have at least 2 pigeons.</p>

<h3 id="example-1">Example 1</h3>
<p>There are 15 people on a bus. Show that at least two of them have a birthday in the same month of the year.</p>

<h4 id="proof">Proof</h4>
<p>Let $A$ be the set of all people on the bus. $\vert A\vert =15$</p>

<p>Let $B$ be the set of months. $\vert B\vert =12$</p>

<p>$f$ associates the month in which a person has been born with that person.</p>

<p>By the pigeonhole principle (PHP), at least two of them have a birthday on the same day.</p>

<h3 id="example-2">Example 2</h3>
<p>How many different surnames must appear in a telephone directory to guarantee that at least two of the surnames begin with the same letter of the alphabet and end with the same letter of the alphabet?</p>

<p>If we are solving this by the pigeonhole principle then the set $A$ of names must have same cardinality as $\vert B\vert +1$ where $B$ is the set of all pairs of letters.</p>

<p>$\vert B\vert =26^2$</p>

<p>Therefore</p>

<p>$\vert B\vert +1=26^2+1$</p>

<h3 id="example-3">Example 3</h3>
<p>Five number are selected from the numbers $1,2,3,4,5,6,7$ and $8$. Show that there will always be two of the numbers that sum to $9$.</p>

<p>$\vert A\vert =5$ and $\vert B\vert =4$. If each element with $x_n$ maps to the pair which contains its digit then there must be a pair with more than one mapping. This is to say that the two sets maps via a <em>surjective</em> function.</p>

<p>This proves that there will always be one pair in the list that sums to 9.</p>
