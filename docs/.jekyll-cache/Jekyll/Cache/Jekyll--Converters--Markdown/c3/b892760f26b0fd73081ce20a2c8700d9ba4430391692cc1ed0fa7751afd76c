<h2 id="er-by-view-integration">ER by View Integration</h2>

<p>You should consider each user perspective separately.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Requirements are given for many users groups or applications independently.</li>
  <li>an ER schema is designed  for each user group and application (typically by different developers.)</li>
  <li>Individual views are merged into a global conceptual schema.</li>
  <li>Individual views can be reconstructed as external schema after view integration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="view-integration">View Integration</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Identification of correspondences and conflicts among schema.
    <ul>
      <li>Need to identify constructs in schemas that represent the same real-world concept.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Modification of views to conform to one another.
    <ul>
      <li>Some of the view schemas may need to be refined to resolve conflicts identified in 1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Merging of views.
    <ul>
      <li>Global schema is created by merging individual schemas.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Restructuring.
    <ul>
      <li>Global schema may require further refinement to remove redundancies or unnecessary complexity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<ol>
  <li>In the example we put up all the diagrams next to each other to view the conflicts. They include:
    <ul>
      <li>Names (including synonyms).
        <ul>
          <li>Homonyms - Using the same name for different things.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Notions
        <ul>
          <li>Where concepts are represented as entities or attributes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>From this you change each view individually to make them coherent with each other.</li>
  <li>After this you eliminate redundancies to make them into a single diagram.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="task">Task</h3>
<p>Draw and ER or EER model to describe a library by using a view integration approach.</p>

<p>The group made this in the first phase:</p>

<p><img src="/UoL/assets/COMP107/Tutorials/2020-11-27-1-1.svg" alt="1st Phase" /></p>

<p class="warning">We should stick very specifically to the story. Over-designing is bad for other people’s designs and you should stick to only the points in your story.</p>

<p class="error">The subject of the user story <strong>does not</strong> need to be included in the diagram. This is because they are the user and don’t need data stored about them to use the database.</p>

<p>The group made this in the second phase.</p>

<p><img src="/UoL/assets/COMP107/Tutorials/2020-11-27-1-2.svg" alt="1st Phase" /></p>

<p class="error">Attributes should not be shared between different entities.</p>

<p class="error">The attribute course should be an entity and not a complex attribute. This would make a student enrolled in many courses.</p>

<h2 id="designing-an-er-schema">Designing an ER Schema</h2>
<p>You should identify basic components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entity types, relationship types, attributes:
    <ul>
      <li>Key attributes.</li>
      <li>Cardinality and participation constrains of relationships.</li>
      <li>Different entity types.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are also weak entities such as tables or chairs. These simple objects don’t need individual identification and should be a child of the strong entity.</p>

<p class="info">The <a href="/UoL/assets/COMP107/Tutorials/2020-11-20-1.pdf">lecture slides</a> have a summary and examples of the ER diagram scheme.</p>

<h2 id="evolutionary-data-modelling">Evolutionary Data Modelling</h2>

<p>Evolutionary data modelling is an approach that proceeds in an incremental manner:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An initial slim model is created that satisfies some initial requirements.</li>
  <li>The model is then refines in a set of iterations adding details.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>Draw an ER model to describe the data need by the conference planner app starting from users stories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 iterations with 8 minutes each.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="task-1">Task 1</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>As a speaker, I want to upload the details of my keynote.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a speaker I want to know then my keynote is scheduled.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="task-2">Task 2</h3>
<ol>
  <li>As a participant I want to register my attendance to a keynote.</li>
  <li>As a participant I want to book a room in a hotel.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/UoL/assets/COMP107/Tutorials/2020-11-20-1-2.png" alt="Screenshot 2" /></p>

<h3 id="task-3">Task 3</h3>
<ol>
  <li>As an organiser, I want to know which conference participants are giving keynotes.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tutor-review">Tutor Review</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Speaker or not is redundant as it is implied by the fact they are presenting or not.</li>
  <li>This is the same for the list of speakers. As it can be derived as a query</li>
  <li>The organiser doesn’t need to be represented as they are just querying.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-describe-data">How to Describe Data</h2>
<p>The ER model describes data in terms of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entities
    <ul>
      <li>A thing which can be distinctly identified</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Attributes
    <ul>
      <li>A property of an entity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Relationships
    <ul>
      <li>An association among entities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-mermaid">erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses
</code></pre>

<p>Attempt a data description of a system you know well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scoping which part of the system do you want to represent</li>
  <li>Write three sentences that are relevant to the system and depict them graphically.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the system of YouTube</p>

<p>The group made the following:</p>

<p>In this tutorial the first main focus was the group project.</p>

<h2 id="user-stories">User Stories</h2>
<p>You might want to use user stories or define user personas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As a… <em>[which type of user has this need?]</em></li>
  <li>I need… <em>[what does the user want to do?]</em></li>
  <li>So that… <em>[why does the user want to do this?]</em></li>
  <li>When… <em>[what triggers the user’s need?]</em></li>
  <li>Because… <em>[what does the user need?]</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="task">Task</h3>
<p>In groups, define three user stories for a conference planner app:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Comic-con, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="user">User</h3>
<h4 id="speaker">Speaker</h4>
<p>As a speaker I need to share slides, knowledge and interact with attendees. This is so that I can present to the attendees throughout the conference because I want to answer user questions and share knowledge.</p>
