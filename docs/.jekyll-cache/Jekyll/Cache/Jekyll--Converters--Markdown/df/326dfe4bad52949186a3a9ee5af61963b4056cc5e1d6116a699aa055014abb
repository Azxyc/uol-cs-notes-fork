<p>You should identify basic components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entity types, relationship types, attributes:
    <ul>
      <li>Key attributes.</li>
      <li>Cardinality and participation constrains of relationships.</li>
      <li>Different entity types.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are also weak entities such as tables or chairs. These simple objects don’t need individual identification and should be a child of the strong entity.</p>

<p class="info">The <a href=".pdf">lecture slides</a> have a summary and examples of the ER diagram scheme.</p>

<h2 id="evolutionary-data-modelling">Evolutionary Data Modelling</h2>

<p>Evolutionary data modelling is an approach that proceeds in an incremental manner:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An initial slim model is created that satisfies some initial requirements.</li>
  <li>The model is then refines in a set of iterations adding details.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>Draw an ER model to describe the data need by the conference planner app starting from users stories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 iterations with 8 minutes each.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="task-1">Task 1</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>As a speaker, I want to upload the details of my keynote.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a speaker I want to know then my keynote is scheduled.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="task-2">Task 2</h3>
<ol>
  <li>As a participant I want to register my attendance to a keynote.</li>
  <li>As a participant I want to book a room in a hotel.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="task-3">Task 3</h3>
<ol>
  <li>As an organiser, I want to know which conference participants are giving keynotes.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tutor-review">Tutor Review</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Speaker or not is redundant as it is implied by the fact they are presenting or not.</li>
  <li>This is the same for the list of speakers. As it can be derived as a query</li>
  <li>The organiser doesn’t need to be represented as they are just querying.</li>
</ul>
