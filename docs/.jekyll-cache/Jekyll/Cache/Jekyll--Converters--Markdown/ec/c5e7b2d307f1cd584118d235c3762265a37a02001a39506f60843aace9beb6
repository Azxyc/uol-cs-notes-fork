<h2 id="designing-an-er-schema">Designing an ER Schema</h2>
<p>You should identify basic components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entity types, relationship types, attributes:
    <ul>
      <li>Key attributes.</li>
      <li>Cardinality and participation constrains of relationships.</li>
      <li>Different entity types.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are also weak entities such as tables or chairs. These simple objects don‚Äôt need individual identification and should be a child of the strong entity.</p>

<p class="info">The <a href=".pdf">lecture slides</a> have a summary and examples of the ER diagram scheme.</p>

<h2 id="evolutionary-data-modelling">Evolutionary Data Modelling</h2>

<p>Evolutionary data modelling is an approach that proceeds in an incremental manner:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An initial slim model is created that satisfies some initial requirements.</li>
  <li>The model is then refines in a set of iterations adding details.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>Draw an ER model to describe the data need by the conference planner app starting from users stories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 iterations with 8 minutes each.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="task-1">Task 1</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>As a speaker, I want to upload the details of my keynote.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a speaker I want to know then my keynote is scheduled.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="task-2">Task 2</h3>
<ol>
  <li>As a participant I want to register my attendance to a keynote.</li>
  <li>As a participant I want to book a room in a hotel.</li>

<h3 id="tutor-review">Tutor Review</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Speaker or not is redundant as it is implied by the fact they are presenting or not.</li>
  <li>This is the same for the list of speakers. As it can be derived as a query</li>

<h1 id="comp107---basic-definitions-in-the-er-model"><a href="/UoL/comp107/lectures/2020/11/18/1.html">COMP107 - Basic Definitions in the ER Model</a></h1>
<p>The entity relationship model is used to express the conceptual schema of a database. It was originally proposed in 1976 as a means to unify the network and relational DB models.</p>

<p>Many theoretical extensions and practical applications have been developed including the <strong>Enhanced Entity Relationship (EER)</strong> model.</p>

<p>It is simple enough to learn and understand the basic concepts and powerful enough to be used in the development of complex applications.</p>

<p>Conceptual designs using the ER model are called <strong>ER Schemas</strong></p>

<h2 id="er-model-components">ER Model Components</h2>
<p>The ER model describes data in terms of three primitive notions.</p>

<h3 id="entities">Entities</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An entity is a thing, which can be distinctly identified.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="attributes">Attributes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A property of an entity.</li>
  <li>They are common properties that are shared by all instances of the entity type.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="complexity-of-attributes">Complexity of Attributes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Complex attributes have structure.
    <ul>
      <li>Dates</li>
      <li>Addresses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Simple attributes only have one component.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cardinality">Cardinality</h4>
<p>Some attributes may have more than one value. If this is the case then you can say that a particular value has a cardinality $&gt;0$.</p>

<h4 id="primitiveness">Primitiveness</h4>
<p>A primitive attribute is any attribute which will be stored as data in the system.</p>

<p>A non-primitive, or derived attribute, can be calculated from other attributes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In some cases it is important that both attributes are indicated on the model
    <ul>
      <li>We should indicate which ones are redundant so that they can be derived.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="relationships">Relationships</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An association among entities.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="degree-of-relationships">Degree of Relationships</h4>
<p>A relationship has a degree that is the number of participating entity types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Binary relationship (degree two).
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>person</strong> owns a <strong>car</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ternary relationships (degree three).
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>lecturer</strong> teaches a <strong>course</strong> to a <strong>student</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="attributes-of-relationships">Attributes of Relationships</h4>
<p>Relationships can have attributes in the case that the attribute is not of an entity but when it is related to the relationship.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the relationship type, ‚Äúperson owns a car‚Äù the attribute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date of purchase</code> is not an attribute of a person and is not an attribute of the car, it is an attribute of the ownership.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="structural-constrains-on-relationships">Structural Constrains on Relationships</h4>
<p>Relationship constraints regulate the possible combinations of entities that can participate in a relationship:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can constrain the number of entities that can participate.</li>
  <li>We can put a constraint on whether some entities must participate.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="relationship-participation">Relationship Participation</h5>
<p>A participation constraint specifies whether an entity must be in the given relationship.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>total participation constraint</strong>, indicates that each instance of an entity must be in that relationship.
    <ul>
      <li>A programme must belong to a department.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>partial participation constraint</strong> specifies that there may exist an entity which does not participate in the relationship.
    <ul>
      <li>Not all lecturers supervise students.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cardinality-of-relationships">Cardinality of Relationships</h4>
<ul>
  <li>One to One
    <ul>
      <li>One department only has one head.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>One to Many
    <ul>
      <li>Each team can have many players but one player can only play for one team.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Many to Many
    <ul>
      <li>A student can be registered for many courses and a course will have may students.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="er-diagram-basics">ER Diagram Basics</h2>
<p>Entity types are represented as boxes:</p>

<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph TD

<p>Relationship types are represented as diamonds connected with each participating entity type. The relationship must have a name.</p>

<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph TD

<p>Attributes are shown as ovals connected to the relevant entity or relation type. In addition key attributes are underlined.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The key attribute should only be underlined if it arises naturally. If not there should be a key put in later in implementation.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph TD

<h2 id="how-to-describe-data">How to Describe Data</h2>
<p>The ER model describes data in terms of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entities
    <ul>
      <li>A thing which can be distinctly identified</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Attributes
    <ul>
      <li>A property of an entity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Relationships
    <ul>
      <li>An association among entities.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Attempt a data description of a system you know well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scoping which part of the system do you want to represent</li>
  <li>Write three sentences that are relevant to the system and depict them graphically.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Identification of Application areas and users groups</li>
  <li>Analysis of existing documentation of application areas</li>
  <li>Analysis of current operating environments and the planned use of the information
    <ul>
      <li>Information flow</li>
      <li>Types of transactions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Responses to user questionnaires are analysed.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result you should start form a place of a poorly structured set of requirements. You should use a technique to move to a more structured document.</p>

<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>

<p>One way to rewrite the specification is to construct a glossary of terms. This will provide:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Term</th>
      <th>Definition</th>
      <th>Synonyms</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<h2 id="purpose-of-assignment-2">Purpose of Assignment 2</h2>
<p>The purpose of Assignment 2 is to analyse the data present in Assignment 1 to create the structure of a database.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should work in groups to complete the data model.</li>
  <li>You will proceed by view aggregation, producing one ER model (or EER if appropriate) conceptualising the view for each of at least 3 user categories you have identified.
    <ul>
      <li>Aim at creating 4 to 5 user stories for each user.</li>
      <li>You will then design the relations tables which map the ER model.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deliverable">Deliverable.</h2>
<p>You will produce a PDF document with your report.</p>

<p>In this tutorial the first main focus was the group project.</p>

<h2 id="user-stories">User Stories</h2>
<p>You might want to use user stories or define user personas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As a‚Ä¶ <em>[which type of user has this need?]</em></li>
  <li>I need‚Ä¶ <em>[what does the user want to do?]</em></li>
  <li>So that‚Ä¶ <em>[why does the user want to do this?]</em></li>

<h1 id="comp107---how-to-cite"><a href="/UoL/comp107/lectures/2020/10/31/3.html">COMP107 - How to Cite</a></h1>
<p>Referencing is a description that identifies an information source, whereas citation is the use of a reference in text.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is not a good practice to simply list all your references at the end of a document without a connection.</li>
  <li>Need to clearly mark what is your own work and what is the work of others.</li>
  <li>Need to help readers get more information on what they are interested in.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stylistic-choices">Stylistic Choices</h2>
<p>You should place citations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Before the punctuation mark (<cite>Smith,1994</cite>).</li>
  <li>At a logical place (<cite>Smith,1994</cite>) in the sentence.</li>
  <li>At a grammatically correct place in a sentence:<br />
According to <cite>Smith (1994)</cite>, there are 50 billion neurons in the human brain.</li>
  <li>Before a list of items:<br />
There are five categories of users <cite>(Anderson, 2008)</cite>: Students, teachers, professors, technical staff, administrative staff.</li>
  <li>Following quotations:<br />
‚ÄúThis is a really cool quotation.‚Äù <cite>(Guy, That, 1994, p. 345)</cite></li>
</ul>

<p class="info">There are examples of correct and incorrect cases on the slides</p>

<h2 id="bibliography-style">Bibliography Style</h2>
<p>A bibliography style determines how the citations and references are presented.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ordinal Number</strong></p>

    <p>Sources listed in the bibliography are sorted according to some ordering, typically based on the authors; names, and numbered consecutively.</p>

    <p>Citations in the text are given as lists of numbers coss-referencing the bibliography, enclosed in square brackets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Author-Date</strong></p>

    <p>Sources in the reference list are arranged alphabetically by the authors‚Äô surnames.</p>

    <p>Work by the same authors are arranged by year of publication, starting with the earliest.</p>

    <p>More than one work with the same authors and date, a letter is added to the year of publication to distinguish them.</p>

    <p>The year of the publication typically immediately follows the list of authors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abbreviation</strong></p>

    <p>Mix of ordinal number style and author-date style.</p>

    <p>Sources in the bibliography are presented like in ordinal number style, but instead of numbering them, each source is given an unique identifier based on authors‚Äô names and year of publication, with additional letter to disambiguate duplicate abbreviations.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="info">Examples of all of these and best practices are given in the slides.</p>

<h1 id="comp107---how-to-reference"><a href="/UoL/comp107/lectures/2020/10/31/2.html">COMP107 - How to Reference</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of referencing is to show how work extends the current state-of-the-art knowledge in the area, proof originality of work, give credit to other people‚Äôs work, support and validate arguments made and demonstrate familiarity with work done in the area.</p>

<h2 id="culture-of-citing">Culture of Citing</h2>
<p>For fiction there might be sources in your work, but these are never acknowledged, unless they serve a literary purpose.</p>

<p>In journalism there must be sources but these are rarely acknowledged. Exceptions may include quotations and for reports. These acknowledgements are not always in a format considered acceptable in academia.</p>

<h2 id="dependency-on-discipline">Dependency on Discipline</h2>
<p>In academic writing all sources that make a contribution to you work must be acknowledged.</p>

<p>Styles can be different from discipline to discipline, for example in philosophy there is a huge amount of referencing. However, in mathematics concepts are often named after the person who made or discovered them or you may use a concept which has very specific wording but you won‚Äôt reference in the same way as a philosophy paper.</p>

<h2 id="rules-of-thumb">Rules of Thumb</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you use words or ideas from any documents, even produced by yourself, then the source must be cited.</li>
  <li>If you gain words or ideas through conversation, written or spoken, the the source must be cited.</li>
  <li>If you use the exact words from any medium it must not only be cited but also indicated as a quotation. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">""</code></li>
  <li>If you reproduce any material then the source must be cited.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="no-citation-is-required-for">No Citation is Required for:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Your own experiences that have not been published before.</li>
  <li>You are writing about your own work that have not been published before.</li>
  <li>You are reusing your own materials.</li>
  <li>You are using common knowledge or generally accepted facts.</li>
  <li>In the context of student submission, if you use facts but not exact words form recommended textbooks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-refer-to-a-source">How to Refer to a Source</h2>
<p>Just by looking at the reference a knowledgeable reader must collect all information about the source. You should also have an idea about the type of a source from the structure.</p>

<p class="info">Refer to the slides for the types of source.</p>

<h3 id="urls-are-not-enough">URLs are not enough</h3>
<p>This is as they don‚Äôt give all the information about a source and may not be valid in the future. URLs are fine when given in addition to other information.</p>

<h3 id="digital-object-identifiers">Digital Object Identifiers</h3>
<p>DOIs are a system of creating a perma-link to a digital reference online. They are preferable over URLS but still they should be given in addition to a conventional reference.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-references">Types of References</h3>
<p>What information is required about  when the work can be obtained depends on it‚Äôs type. For example here are references for a book<sup id="fnref:book" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:book" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and a journal paper<sup id="fnref:paper" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:paper" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-we-form-our-knowledge">How to we form our knowledge?</h2>
<p>Generally we form our personal collection of facts from sources that we meet in our every day life. This means that a good proportion of the knowledge we might think that we have is composed of myths. This is especially found in <em>news</em> articles.</p>

<p>These articles are generally based in fact in the sense that they reference real journals. The articles covert the unreadable and specialised format of the journal into a more sensationalised and popularised format.</p>

<h2 id="assessing-the-source">Assessing the Source</h2>
<h3 id="argument-from-expert-opinion">Argument from Expert Opinion</h3>
<p>When assessing arguments from expert opinion the following must be taken into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expertise
    <ul>
      <li>How credible is the source?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Field
    <ul>
      <li>Is the source expert in the field?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Opinion
    <ul>
      <li>What did the source actually say? When?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Trustworthiness
    <ul>
      <li>Is the use of the source reliable or does the writer have any alternator motive where they might not want to portray the data as it was collected?</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Consistency
    <ul>
      <li>Is the source consistent with others?

<h2 id="main-academic-sources">Main Academic Sources</h2>
<h3 id="scholarly-vs-popular">Scholarly v.s. Popular</h3>
<p>A scholarly paper is a way for expert in the field to communicate their results, typically to other experts in the field.</p>

<p>A popular paper is a communication to the general public about some research. They may not be as rigorous or detailed as a scholarly paper.</p>

<h3 id="conference-papers">Conference Papers</h3>
<p>Gatherings for researchers to present and discuss their work, typically related to a particular academic discipline and often held at regular intervals.</p>

<p>Output published in ‚Äúconference proceedings‚Äù in the form of conference papers written by the researchers about their work, and often peer-reviewed</p>

<p>Types of events:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conference</li>
  <li>Workshop</li>
  <li>Symposium</li>
</ul>

<p>You should check the acceptance ratio to check what people think of the paper.</p>

<h3 id="journal-articles">Journal Articles</h3>
<p>Academic journals are peer-reviewed periodicals in with research relating to a particular academic discipline is published.</p>

<p>Each issue of a journal contains a collection of articles, each article written by a group of researchers.</p>

<p>There may be <em>special issues</em> on a single topic.</p>

<h2 id="dependency-on-discipline">Dependency on Discipline</h2>
<p>Computer Science is a dynamic subject, and communication of results, and publication, <strong>relies heavily on conferences</strong>.</p>

<p>This is compared to other disciplines which focus on publishing in journals.</p>

<h3 id="therefore">Therefore</h3>
<p>A prestigious Computer Science conference has  a very rigorous peer review process. Papers tend to be longer and more exhaustive.</p>

<p>A medical conference, for contrast, will present mainly 300 word abstracts with the intention that a full paper will follow on a journal.</p>

<h2 id="publication-pipeline">Publication Pipeline</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Authors submit paper to conference/journal for peer review.
    <ul>
      <li>At least two peer reviews reading independently.</li>
      <li>For journals, they could have many iterations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If accepted, the paper is revised by the authors and submitted to the conference journal editor.</li>
  <li>The paper is processed to bring it into the publisher‚Äôs format (typesetting/layout).</li>
  <li>The paper is then included in the publisher‚Äôs database and possibly published in printed form.</li>
  <li>Literature databases collect the bibliographic information from several publishers, and add additional information (references with links, citation index) and link back to publisher for full text of papers.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="publisher-databases-and-search-engines">Publisher Databases and Search Engines</h2>
<p>Have a look at the slides or a list of the publishers that the university subscribes to on the library page: <a href="http://liv.ac.uk/library">Discover (UoL)</a>.</p>

<p>If a journal is included in a journal/proceedings database then there has been a review process in order for it to be accepted. This may mean that it is more trustworthy.</p>

<p>Get into the habit of using <a href="scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> to find other papers or number of citations leading to a paper.</p>

<p>The site <a href="arXiv.org">ArXiv.org</a> hosts pre-prints of papers that are moderated but not peer-reviewed. This allows us to get bleeding edge information on very current topics such as COVID-19. They should be taken in context.</p>

<h3 id="dbs-vs-search-engines">DBs v.s. Search Engines</h3>
<p>Literary databases cover a vast number of academic sources but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They do not cover all journals conferences.</li>
  <li>They do not cover books.</li>
  <li>They do not cover workshops and similar scientific meetings.</li>
  <li>They do not cover technical reports and pre-prints.</li>
</ul>

<p>Web search engines provide much better coverage of all types of publications but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Typically also return a lot of irrelevant material to a query.</li>
  <li>Leave it to the user to distinguish high quality form low quality material.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="comp107---requirement-elicitation"><a href="/UoL/comp107/lectures/2020/10/24/1.html">COMP107 - Requirement Elicitation</a></h1>
<p>The process of obtaining, through systematic research the requirements of a system form the various users, customers and other stakeholders.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Needs a principle approach as it is often hard for users to articulate their need or their business problems.</li>
  <li>Any system that doesn‚Äôt meet the users need is neither useful nor useable.</li>

<p>When eliciting from people you should take into account who you want to talk to. There should be adequate stakeholders to get comprehensive coverage. There should be selection based on role, position, decision power, usage, expertise, exposure to problems, interests and influence on uptake.</p>

<p>Interviewing can also be difficult as there may be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conflicting points of view.</li>
  <li>Different backgrounds, culture, terminology.</li>
  <li>Different languages, jargon, hidden knowledge.</li>
  <li>Internal politics and dynamics.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<h2 id="data-gathering-techniques">Data Gathering Techniques</h2>

<p class="info">For a grid of data gathering techniques and their pros and cons view the slides for this lecture.</p>

<p>User stories could apply to all three methods. These are anecdotal stories in the workplace that apply to the issue. Enduring stories capture all aspect of the organisation and are  the ones a systems analysts should be looking for.</p>

<p>Stories can be used to <strong>validate</strong> the companies decision, <strong>explain</strong> why the company acted in a certain way, describe an <strong>experience</strong> or <strong>prescribe</strong> the listener how to act. They can be used to complement other methods.</p>

<p>The main methods to gather information are:</p>

<h3 id="questionnaires">Questionnaires</h3>
<ul>
  <li>They are useful in gathering form <strong>key users</strong> or potential users. They can collect information on:
    <ul>
      <li>Attitudes</li>
      <li>Beliefs</li>
      <li>Behaviours</li>
      <li>Characteristics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interviewing">Interviewing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>They are painful as they need to be planned. The following should be considered:
    <ul>
      <li>Dispersion of organisation members.</li>
      <li>Number of members.</li>
      <li>Exploratory work required.</li>
      <li>Problem solving prior to the interviews.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Interviewing is an important method of collecting data on human and system information requirements. They reveal information about:
    <ul>
      <li>Opinions</li>
      <li>Feelings</li>
      <li>Goals</li>
      <li>Key user experience concerns.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Due to the instant nature of interviews there should be some preparation for the interview.
    <ul>
      <li>Reading background material.</li>
      <li>Establishing interview objectives.</li>
      <li>Deciding whom to interview.</li>
      <li>Preparing the interviewee.</li>
      <li>Deciding on question types and structure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A pyramid or funnel method should be used in interviewing questions. You should start with a very general question and add more details to get to the source of the problem.</li>
  <li>Reports should be written as soon a possible after the interview so that as much detail is retained as possible. Two people can take notes to compare later.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="joint-application-design">Joint application design</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Involving the users from the start in the design of the system.</li>
  <li>The users will develop a greater link to the system. This will make the system more useful to them.</li>
  <li>You should consider if the issue meets the following requirements before using this method:
    <ul>
      <li>Users want something new and bespoke.</li>
      <li>The organisational culture supports joint problem solving behaviours and allows leave to participate in the exercise.</li>
      <li>The analyst reckons that many more ideas will be generated using JAD than with one-to-one sessions.</li>
      <li>The analyst should also be trained in the technique.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>People involved:
    <ul>
      <li>Executive sponsor</li>
      <li>System analyst</li>
      <li>Users</li>
      <li>Session leaders</li>
      <li>Observers</li>
      <li>Scribe</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Benefits of JAD:
    <ul>
      <li>Time is saved, compared with traditional interviewing.</li>
      <li>Rapid development of systems.</li>
      <li>Creative idea production is improved.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Drawbacks of JAD:
    <ul>
      <li>It requires a large block of time to be available for all session participants.</li>
      <li>If preparation or the follow-up report is incomplete the session may not be successful.</li>
      <li>The organisational skills and culture may not be conducive to a JAD session.</li>
    </ul>

<p>SAD seeks to understand what humans need to analyse data input or data flow systematically, process or transform data, store data, and output information in the context of a particular organisation or enterprise.</p>

<h2 id="information---a-key-resource">Information - A Key Resource</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Information needs to be managed correctly.</li>
  <li>Managing computer-generated information differs from handling manually produced data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="need-for-sad">Need for SAD</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Installing a system without proper planning leads to great user dissatisfaction and frequently causes the system to fall into disuse.</li>
  <li>SAD provides structure to the analysis and design of information systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="system-analyst">System Analyst</h2>
<h3 id="role">Role</h3>
<p>The analyst must be able to work with people of all descriptions and be experience in working with computers. They have three primary roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consultant
    <ul>
      <li>Hired specifically to address information systems  issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Supporting Expert
    <ul>
      <li>Not managing the project but giving professional advice for specific issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Agent of Change
    <ul>
      <li>Most comprehensive role, introduction dramatic modifications to the organisation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h3 id="qualities">Qualities</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Problem Solver</li>
  <li>Communicator</li>
  <li>Strong personal and professional ethics.</li>
  <li>Self-disciplined and self-motivated.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="systems-development-life-cycle">Systems Development Life Cycle</h2>
<p>This is a phased approach to solving business problems by using a specific cycle of analyst and user activities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>UX or user experience is a large factor in SAD and by taking a <strong>human-centred approach</strong> the project will be much more successful.</li>
