## Defining Custom Functions
Functions are defined as such:

```haskell
[functionName][arguments][=][body]
```

Functions and arguments must start with small letters as only types use capitals.

They can be written into a file and loaded into GHCI or compiled for use in a program. An example of a simple function:

```haskell
addTwo x = x + 2
twoInAddTwo x y = x + y + 2
```

Additional functions are available in [the slides]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP105/Lectures/2020-10-14-2.pdf).

## Loading Functions
* To load a functions from a file run GHCI on the file. `$ ghci functions.hs` 
* To reload the current file run `:reload` in GHCI.
* To load in a file run `:load` and the file-path.

## Comments
Single line comments can be written `-- like this`

Multi-line comments can be written:

```haskell
{- Like
   this-}
```

## Compilation
Instead of running code in the interpreter you can compile it using GHC. To print the output to the `StdOut` you can use the two functions `putStrln(show())` to convert the output to a string and print that to the `StdOut`.

This is part of the IO function-set and won't be used again for a while.

## Exercises
1. ```haskell
	double x = 2 * x
	```
	
1. ```haskell
	pythagoras a b  = sqrt (a ** 2 + b ** 2)
	```
	* Must use the float exponentiation operator to allow for floats as a or b.
	
1. ```haskell
	maxFour a b c d = max (max a b) (max c d)`
	```
