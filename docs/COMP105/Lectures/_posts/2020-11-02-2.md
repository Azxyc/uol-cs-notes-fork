## Cracking the Caesar Cipher
In order to crack a Caesar Cipher you can use the fact that, in English, each letter isn't used equally. From this you can shift around the letters until you find a shift that fits the distribution of the English language.

As a result of this you should be able to write a program that can guess and decode an English Caesar Shift.

### Chi-Squared Score

`{% raw %}\[
\sum^z_{i=a}{\frac{(\text{freq}_i-\text{english}_i)^2}{\text{english}_i}}
\]{% endraw %}`

To check if two frequency distributions are similar you can use the chi-squared score. The lower the output the closer the distributions match.

The algorithm will complete the following tasks:

* Try all 26 possible shifts
* For each one, compute the letter frequency distribution of the decoded text, and the chi-squared score.
* Use the shift with the lowest chi-squared score.
