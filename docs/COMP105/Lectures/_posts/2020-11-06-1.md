## Types
Everything in Haskell has a type. In GHCI `:type` or `:t` will display the type of an expression.

### Basic Types
#### `Int`
Holds a 64-bit integer between \(-2^{63}\) and \(2^{63}-1\)

#### `Integer`
Holds arbitrary size integers but is slightly slower than an `Int`. Ideally you should use an `Int` if you are using smaller numbers.

#### `Float`
Holds 32-bit floating point numbers.

#### `Double`
Holds a 64-bit floating point number.

#### `Bool`
Holds truth values.

#### `Char`
Holds a single character and can store any Unicode character.

### Compound Types
#### Tuples
The type of a tuple is the type of its constituents.

* The size of a tuple is encoded in its type.
* Tuple elements can be different types.

#### Lists
The type of a list is determined by the type of its elements.

* A list of type`x` is denoted by `[x]`.
* This is why lists must contain elements of the same type.
* The length is not encoded in the type.

## Exercises
1. `:: [Bool]`
1. `:: ([[Bool]], [Char])`
	* As strings are just lists of `Char` then you must represent them as such.
1. `:: [([Bool], Bool)]`
