## Higher Order Functions
A higher order function is a function that:

* Takes another function as an argument.
* Returns a function.

```haskell
apply_twice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
apply_twice f input = f (f input)

> apply_twice tail [1,2,3,4]
> [3,4]
```

This function takes a function and an input as an argument and then uses the supplied function twice on the supplied argument.

An example including currying (partial application):

```haskell
> apply_twice (drop 2) [1,2,3,4,5]
> [5]
```

A caveat of using this function is that it must return the same type that is is given.

### Function Composition
Function composition applies one function to the output of another 

* Composing `f` with `g input` gives `f (g input)`

```haskell
compose :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
compose f g input = f (g input)

> compose (+1) (*2) 4
> 9
```

This is the same thing as applying a function to another function.

#### The `.` Operator
The type of `.` is:

```haskell
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
```

The `.` operator is an infix operator called compose. To complete the same action as will the `compose` function write:

```haskell
> ((+1) . (*2)) 4
> 9
```

This means to apply the left function on the argument and then the right function on the result of the previous function.

```haskell
f list = length (double (drop_evens (tail list)))

f' list = (length . double . drop evens . tail) list
```

As you can see from the two different implementations; the use of `.` removes the need for nested brackets, however:

* It is stylistic.
* You never need to use `.`
* It is preferred.

### The `$` Operator

```haskell
evaluate :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
evaluate f input = f input
```

The `$` operator is exactly the same as evaluate. `$` is infix.

The `$` operator has the lowest precedence of any operator. As a result it can be used in place of brackets:

```haskell
((*2) . length) [1,2,3,4]
(*2) . length $ [1,2,3,4]

length ([1,2,3] ++ [4,5,6])
length $ [1,2,3] + [4,5,6]
```

## Exercises

	applyThrice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
	applyThrice f x = f . f . f $ x
	```
	
1. ```
	f :: (Ord a, Enum a) => [a] -> a
	f x = succ . sum . tail . tail $ x
