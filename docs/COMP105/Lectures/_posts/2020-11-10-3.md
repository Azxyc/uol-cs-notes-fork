## Anonymous Functions
Sometimes is it convenient to define a function inline. Anonymous functions allow you to use a function without a name.

```haskell
> (\ x -> x + 1) 7
> 8
```

This allows you to pass functions to a higher order function without giving it a name:

```haskell
> apply_twice (\ x -> 2 * x ) 2
> 8
```

### Syntax
The syntax for an anonymous function is:

```haskell
\ [arg1] [arg2]  ... -> [expression]
```

The `\` is supposed to resemble an lambda &#92;(\lambda&#92;).

* Anonymous function are sometimes called &#92;(\lambda&#92;)-functions in recognition of lambda calculus.

### Functions that Return Functions
Higher order functions can also return other functions:

```haskell
f_than_adds_n :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
f_that_adds_n n = (\x -> x + n)

> let f = (f_that_adds_n 10) in (f 1)
> 11
```

This function returns another function that you can use in other functions.

Higher order function can take and return functions:

```haskell
swap f = \ x y -> f y x
```

This is a two argument function and then swaps the arguments for the function.

```haskell
g = swap take
```

This has swapped the arguments for the function `take` and can be called with `g`

### Currying Revisited
Previously we've seen that it is possible to partially apply a function:

```haskell
add_two = (+2)
```

This is just a nicer syntax for a function that returns a function:

```haskell
add_two = (\ x -> x + 2)
```

## Exercises
1. ```
	(\ x y -> x + y)
	```
	
1. ```
	addChar c = (\ string -> string ++ [c])
	```
	
1. ```
	curry' :: ((a, b) -> c) -> (a -> b -> c)
	curry' f = (\ x y -> f (x, y))
	```
