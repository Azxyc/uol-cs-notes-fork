## `map`
`map` applies a funciton `f` to every element in a list.

```haskell
map' :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map' _ [] = []
map' f (x:xs) = f x : map' f xs
```

This saves you from writing out the generic code for applying a function to a list. This allows you to implement the standard functions instead of having to make your own.

```haskell
map even [1..5]
> [False,True,False,True,False]
```

This avoids writing a recursive function for applying simple list operations.

### Currying and `map`
It is common to use curried functions with `map`:

```haskell
map (*2) [1..5]
> [2,4,6,8,10]
```

You can also use map to make other functions:

```haskell
doubleList = map (*2)

> doubleList [1..5]
> [2,4,6,8,10]
```

### Anonymous Functions and Map
It is also common to use an anonymous functions with map:

```haskell
map (\\x -> x * x) [1..5]
> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

This lets you apply your own functions to a list without having to define it.

### Nested Maps
When working with nested lists, it is common to use nested maps.

```haskell
map(map (*2)) [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8]]
> [[2,4,5],[8,10,12],[14,16]]

import Data.Char

map (map toUpper) ["the","quick","brown"]
["THE","QUICK","BROWN"]
```

This application uses currying in the inner map. It is also especially useful for lists containing strings.

## Exercises
1. `cubeList = map (^3)`
1. `middleElem = map (\\ (_,x,_) -> x)`
1. `ruinStrings = map (map (\\ x -> if x == 'e' then 'x' else x))`
