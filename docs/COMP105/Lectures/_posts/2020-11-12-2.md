## `filter`
`filter`keeps only the elements for which `f` returns `True`.

```haskell
filter' :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter' _ [] = []
filter' f (x:xs)
	| f x 		= x : rest
	| otherwise	= rest
	where rest 	= filter' f xs
	
filter' even [1..10]
> [2,4,6,8,10]
```

In comparison to `map` which applies a function to each element in a list. `filter` will apply a boolean test to each element in the list and if it fails it will remove the element from the list.

### Combining `map` & `filter`

```haskell
square_even :: [Int] -> [Int]
square_even list = map (^2) (filter even list)

square_even [1..10]
> [4,16,36,64,100]
```

## Higher Order Programming
`map` and `filter` are examples of higher order programming. This style:

* De-emphasises recursion.
* Focuses on applying functions to lists.
* Are available in imperative languages (Python C++).

There is a whole family of higher order programming functions available in Haskell.

## Exercises
1. `onlyDiv3 = filter (\#92;x -> mod x 3 == 0)`
1. `onlyLower = filter (\#92;x -> elem x ['a'..'z'])`
1. `noEven = map (filter odd)`
