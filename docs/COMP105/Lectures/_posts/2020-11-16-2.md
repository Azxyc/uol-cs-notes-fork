## Fold Continued
A fold output can be a different type to the input list.

```haskell
to_csv list = foldr (\#92;x acc -> show x ++ "," ++ acc)  "" list

> to_csv [1,2,3,4]
> "1,2,3,4,"
```

By using `foldr` you cannot get the desired outcome as it applies the same rule to every item in the list.

### `foldr1`
The function `foldr1` uses the final value of the list to initialise the accumulator:

```haskell
foldr1 :: (a -> a -> a) -> [a] -> a

foldr1' _ [] = error "empty list"
foldr1' -[x] = x
foldr1' f (x:xs) = f x (foldr1' f xs)

> foldr1' (+) [1,2,3,4,5]
> 15
```

As the accumulator has the same type as the list elements `foldr1` cannot have a different type to that of the elements in the list.

#### Example

```haskell
maximum' list = foldr1 (\#92; x acc -> if x > acc then x else acc) list

> maximum [1,2,3,4,3,2,1]
> 4
```

In this example `foldr1` is required as your initialisation may become the maximum value.

### `foldl`
`foldr` processes lists from the right. The opposite of this is `foldl` which processes lists from the left. For many functions like `+` the ordering doesn't matter but for other functions such as `/`.

#### Type of `foldl`
The function `f` has its type flipped compared to the other `fold` function:

```haskell
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
```

This also means that you should swap your functions:

* `foldr (\#92; x acc -> ...`
* `foldr (\#92; acc x -> ...`

##### Example

```haskell
reverse_list list = foldl (\#92; acc x -> x : acc) [] list

> reverse_list [1,2,3,4]
> [4,3,2,1]
```

## Exercises
1. `sumFsts list = foldr (\#92; (x,_) acc -> x + acc) 0 list`
1. `minimum list = foldr1 (\#92; x acc -> if x < acc then x else acc) list`
1. `dash string = foldl (\#92; acc x -> acc ++ [x, '-']) "" string`
