## More Higher Order Functions - Continued
### `takewhile`
This function takes while a condition is true.

```haskell
> takeWhile (<=5) [1..10]
> [1,2,3,4,5]
```

This is different to `filter` which only removes individual elements. 

```haskell
> takeWhile (&#92; x -> length x <= 2) ["ab","cd","efg"]
> ["ab", "cd"]
```

#### Implementation

```haskell
takeWhile' :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]

takeWhile' _ [] = []
takeWhile' f (x:xs)
	| f x = x : takeWhile' f xs
	| otherwise = []
```

### `dropWhile`
This is the opposite of the previous function:

```haskell
> dropWhile (==1) [1,1,2,2,3,3]
> [2,2,3,3]
```

You can also use functions:

```haskell
> dropWhile (&#92; x -> x < 10 && x > 0) [1,2,3,10,4,5]
> [10,4,5]
```

#### Implementation

```haskell
dropWhile' :: (A -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]

dropWhile' _ [] = []
dropWhile' f (x:xs)
	| f x = dropWhile' f xs
	| otherwise = x:xs
```

### `takeWhile` & `dropWhile` Example
This function splits up the words in a string into a list of strings containing no spaces.

```haskell
split_words "" = []
split_words string =
	let
		first = takeWhile (/= ' ') string
		up_to_space = dropWhile (&#92;= ' ') string
		after_space = dropWhile (== ' ') up_to_space
	in
		first : split_words after_space

> split_words "one two		three"
> ["one","two","three"]
```

### `words`
The function that was made in the last example has a standard implementation called `words`.

### `unwords`
This is the companion function to `words`. They aren't quite inverses as `unwords` will put spaces inbetween each word.

### `zipWith`
This function zips two lists together using a function:

```haskell
> zipWith (+) [1,2,3] [4,5,6]
> [5,7,9]

> zipWith (&#92; x y -> if x then y else -y) [True, False, True] [1,2,3]
> [1,-2,-3]
```

#### Implementation

```haskell
zipWith' :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]

zipWith' _ [] _ = []
zipWith' _ _ [] = []
zipWith' f (x:xs) (y:ys) = f x y : zipWith' f xs ys
```

#### Examples

```haskell
mult_by_pos list = zipWith (*) list [0..]

> mult_by_pos [1,2,3]
> [0,2,6]
```

```haskell
interleave str1 str2 = 
	let
		zipped = zipWith (&#92; x y -> [x,y]) str1 str2
	in
		concat zipped

> interleave "abc" "123"
> "a1b2c3"
```

In this example `concat` is used to make lists of strings into a single string.

## Exercises
1. ```haskell
	getNumber string = takeWhile (&#92; x -> elem x ['0'..'9']) string
	```

1. ```hasell
	wordCount string = length??????words string
	```

1. ```haskell
	numberWords string = zip??????words string??????[1..]
	```
