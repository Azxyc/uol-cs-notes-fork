## Marks to Report Example
This lecture covers a mini assignment example about converting a csv file containing students marks into a report containing the students averages. These are presented in the following format:

```csv
aaa		70	65	67	60
bbb		55	60	55	65
ccc		40	40	40	40
ddd		80	60	75	60
ccc		0	0	0	100
```

And should be transformed to be:

```csv
aaa		65.5
bbb		58.75
ccc		40.0
ddd		68.75
ccc		25.0
```

See the [slides](COMP105201119-1.pdf) for the full examples.

### Reading files in Haskell
We can read a file using `readFile`:

* This is an IO function.
* We will study this in more detail later on.

```haskell
> readfile "marks.csv"
> "aaa		70	65	67	60\nbbb		55	60	55...
```

The `\n` character is the newline character.

### `lines`
The lines function takes a string containing multiple lines into a list of strings. The complement to this function is the function `unlines`. This will do the opposite.

### Parsing the File
Using the functions `words` and `lines` we can put the file into a list of lists of strings, in order to process the file.

### Getting the Averages
The function `read` will convert a string into a float.

### Writing the Output File
The function `writeFile` will write some data into a file:

```haskell
> writeFile "test.txt" "hello"
```

This is not a pure function and we will see it again later.

### All in One Function
The pure function portion of the exercise will read as the following:

```haskell
report file = 
	let
		parsed		= map words . lines $ file
		students	= map name parsed
		averages	= map average parsed
		zipped		= zipWith report_line students averages
	in
		unlines zipped
```
