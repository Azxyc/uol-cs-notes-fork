## Role Call
All members were present apart from Josef.

## Users
We started to work on the colaborative document by identifiying our key users. The users we thought of were:

* Families
* Disabled People
* Shopper
* Buisness Managers

### User Stories
We also discussed and started work on the user stories using the template defined in the leactures which was:

```
As a (role) I want (something) to that (benefit).
```

```
As a...
I need/want/expect to...
So that...
When...
Because... # if the user constrained by any circumstances
```

We started making user stories based on this template.

## EER Diagrams
To complete the rest of this document we should take a free user story and leave a note that we are working in it. We will **reconvene on Friday** to continue assignments and merge EER diagrams if they haven't been done already.
