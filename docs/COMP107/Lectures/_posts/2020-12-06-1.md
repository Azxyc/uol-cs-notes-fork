## Map ER &#92;(\rightarrow&#92;) Relations
The aim of this phase is to construct a logical schema, that correctly an efficiently represent all of the information described by the conceptual schema.

This is not always just a simple translation:

* In some cases there is no close correspondence between conceptual and logical schema. 

* This is because the aim of conceptual design is to represent data accurately and naturally from a hight level, computer-independent performances of the final, computer based product.

### Decisions
These decisions are especially relevant for the relational model.
{:.info}

1. Analysis of Redundancies
	* Decide whether to delete or retain possible redundancies.
1. Dealing with Unsupported Concepts.
	* Deciding how to map with generalisation with other construct when using a relational model.
1. Partitioning and Merging
	* Partition of entities employee to distinguish between Personal data and Professional data on the basis of frequency of access.
1. Selection of Primary Identifiers
	* Adding new attributes to entities which do not have a natural primary key.
1. Decide how to deal with derived notions
	* Derived attributes can be represented as **virtual fields**.
	* As part of a user interface (at visualisation).
	* Implemented as a query.
	* Just ignored.
	* Sometimes relations can be derived (cyclic relations) such as:
	
		```mermaid
		graph LR
		TRAINEE --> A{ATTENDS}
		A --> COURSE
		COURSE --> T{TEACHES}
		T --> INSTRUCTOR
		INSTRUCTOR --> AS{ASSIGNED TO}
		AS --> TRAINEE
		```
		
		In this example you need to decide whether ASSIGNED TO can be derived from the relationships, or is a relationship of its own.

### Step by Step Process
After  restructuring, it's just a straightforward process, which considers each concept in turn and with a specific order:

1. Regular entities.
1. Weak entities.
1. Binary one-to-one relationships.
1. Binary one-to-many relationships.
1. Binary many-to-many relationships.
1. Multi-valued attributes.
	* Binary one-to-many relation.
1. N-ary relationships.
1. Generalisations/ specifications

#### Step 1 - Regular Entity Types
For each regular (non weak) entity types &#92;(E&#92;) in the ER schema, create a relation (table) that includes:

* All the simple, primitive attributes of &#92;(E&#92;).
* All the simple components of &#92;(E&#92;).
* Also, choose one of the candidate key attributes as primary key.

This ignores **derived** and **multi-valued** attributes.
{:.warning}

For an example of an INSTRUCTOR you could make the following table:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP107/Lectures/2020-12-06-1-1.png)

This would ignore the attributes:

* Age
	* This is a derived attribute as you can calculate is from their year of birth.
* PhoneNumber
	* This is a multi-valued attribute as they may have more than one.

#### Step 2 - Weak Entity Types
For each weak entity type &#92;(W&#92;), create a relation (table that includes:

* All the simple, primitive attributes and all the simple components of composite attributes of &#92;(W&#92;). 
* The primary key attribute(s) of the table &#92;(T&#92;) that corresponds to &#92;(W&#92;)'s owner entity type.
* Choose as primary key the combination of all attributes taken from &#92;(T&#92;) and the partial key &#92;(W&#92;) (if any).

As you can see the primary key of trainee is used as a foreign in the the PROFESSIONAL table.

#### Step 3 - Binary one-to-one
For each binary relationship type &#92;(R&#92;) in the ER schema:

* Identify &#92;(T&#92;) and &#92;(S&#92;), relations corresponding to the entity types participating in &#92;(R&#92;).
* Consider the relation &#92;(T&#92;) whose entity types has a total participation to &#92;(R&#92;), if any, or choose any of the two if both have partial participation to &#92;(R&#92;).
* Include the attribute(s) forming the primary key of &#92;(S&#92;) as foreign key in &#92;(T&#92;).
* Include all the simple primitive attributes and the simple components of attributes &#92;(R&#92;) in &#92;(T&#92;).

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP107/Lectures/2020-12-06-1-3.png)

As a result of the enforced link (with the double line) we can include the attributes of the DIRECTOR relation in the table for COURSE TYPE.
{:.info}

#### Step 4 - Binary one-to-many
For each regular (non weak) binary 1:N relationship type &#92;(R&#92;):

* Identify relation &#92;(S&#92;) that corresponds to the entity type as the many side.
* Identify relation &#92;(T&#92;) that corresponds to the entity type at the one side.
* Include as a foreign key in &#92;(S&#92;) the primary key of &#92;(T&#92;).
* Include all the simple, primitive attributes and the simple components of attributes of &#92;(R&#92;) in &#92;(S&#92;).

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP107/Lectures/2020-12-06-1-4.png)

To create the link from the employee to the employer the EMPLOYEE table must have the EmployerCode attribute.
{:.info}

#### Step 5 - Binary many-to-many
For each binary N:M relationship type &#92;(R&#92;) in the ER schema:

* Identify the relations &#92;(S&#92;) and &#92;(T&#92;) that correspond to the entity types participating to &#92;(R&#92;).
* Create a new relation and include as foreign keys all the attributes forming the primary key of &#92;(S&#92;) and all the attributes forming the primary key of &#92;(T&#92;).
* Include in the new relation all the simple, primitive attributes and the simple components of attributes of &#92;(R&#92;).

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP107/Lectures/2020-12-06-1-5.png)

You can see the introduction of the bridge table here in order to link the two tables. This breaks the many-to-many relation into two one-two-many relations. The primary key of the link table is a composite of the existing keys.

#### Step 6 - Multi-valued Attributes
For each multi-valued attribute &#92;(A&#92;) of an entity type &#92;(E&#92;) in the ER schema: 

* Identify the relation &#92;(T&#92;) that corresponds to &#92;(E&#92;).
* Create a new relation &#92;(S&#92;) that includes an attribute corresponding to &#92;(A&#92;) and all the attributes forming the primary key of &#92;(T&#92;).
* If the multi-valued attribute is composite, include the simple components.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP107/Lectures/2020-12-06-1-6.png)

#### Step 7 - N-ary Relationships

For each n-ary (&#92;(n>2&#92;)) relationships type &#92;(R&#92;) in the ER schema:

* Identify relations: &#92;(T_1,T_2,\ldots,T_n&#92;) that correspond to the entity types participating to &#92;(R&#92;).
* Create a new relation including as foreign key the attributes forming the primary key of each of the tables: &#92;(T_1,T_2,\ldots,T_n&#92;).
* Include all the simple, primitive attributes and the simple components of attributes &#92;(R&#92;).

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP107/Lectures/2020-12-06-1-7.png)

Here we are creating a bridge table but including all the primary keys of all the participating entities.
{:.info}

These steps mean that the following diagram:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP107/Lectures/2020-12-06-1-8.png)

will be turned into the following linked tables:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP107/Lectures/2020-12-06-1-9.png)

### Remarks
An alternative mapping of a one-to-one relationship type is possible by merging the two entity types and the relationship into a single relation:

* Particularly appropriate when both participation are total.
* The two entity types should not participate to other relationship types in isolation.

A one-to-one or a one-to-many relationship type can always be mapped similarly to the method for many-to-many relationship types:

* Particularly useful when few relationship instances exist in order to avoid `null` values in the foreign key. 

### Relational v.s. ER
Relational model does not allow relationship types to be represented explicitly:

* Relationships are represented using primary keys and foreign keys as attributes in relations.

A operations called **natural join** allows combinations of all record pairs in order to materialise the relationship:

* Binary 1:1 or 1:N relationships require one join.
* Binary N:M relationships require tow joins.
* N-ary relationships require &#92;(n&#92;) joins.

Relational model does not allow multi-valued attributes.

* Have to create separate relations for each multi-valued attribute.
* Key attribute of the relevant entity is repeated for each value.
* Need a join to relate the multi-valued attribute to the entity:
	* Object-oriented, network and hierarchical models do support multi-valued attributes.
	* Seen as a flaw in normalised relational models.
