## Methods of Proof
* Counter Example Method
	* Prove that a statement is false by use of a counter-statement.
* Universal Proof
	* Applies to all integers e.g. odd if {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(a=2k+1\)]]>{% endraw %}
	
## Example
{% raw %}<![CDATA[\[(a+b)^2=a^2+b^2\]]]>{% endraw %}

Holds for:

* Some integers
* All integers
* No integers

The answer is that it holds for some integers as when {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(a=0,\ b=0\)]]>{% endraw %}. {% raw %}<![CDATA[\[ (0+0)^2=0^2+0^2\]]]>{% endraw %} This also follows for {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(a\neq0,\ b=0\)]]>{% endraw %}.

The two proofs I gave as answers to the question count for both a counter example proof and a universal proof.

## Example of Proof by Contradiction
Suppose for a proof by contradiction that {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(P_n\)]]>{% endraw %} is the largest prime number. Therefore, {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(P_1\ldots P_n\)]]>{% endraw %} are all the primes.

Consider {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(P=P_1\times P_2\ldots P_n+1\)]]>{% endraw %}

Case 1: {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(P_p\)]]>{% endraw %} is prime

Case 2: {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(P_p\)]]>{% endraw %} not prime. Then {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(P\)]]>{% endraw %} must have prime member.
