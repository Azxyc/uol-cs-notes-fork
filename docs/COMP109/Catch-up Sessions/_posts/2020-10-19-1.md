## Methods of Proof
* Counter Example Method
	* Prove that a statement is false by use of a counter-statement.
* Universal Proof
	* Applies to all integers e.g. odd if &#92;(a=2k+1&#92;)
	
## Example
&#92;[(a+b)^2=a^2+b^2&#92;]

Holds for:

* Some integers
* All integers
* No integers

The answer is that it holds for some integers as when &#92;(a=0,\ b=0&#92;). &#92;[ (0+0)^2=0^2+0^2&#92;] This also follows for &#92;(a\neq0,\ b=0&#92;).

The two proofs I gave as answers to the question count for both a counter example proof and a universal proof.

## Example of Proof by Contradiction
Suppose for a proof by contradiction that &#92;(P&#95;n&#92;) is the largest prime number. Therefore, &#92;(P&#95;1\ldots P&#95;n&#92;) are all the primes.

Consider &#92;(P=P&#95;1\times P&#95;2\ldots P&#95;n+1&#92;)

Case 1: &#92;(P&#95;p&#92;) is prime

Case 2: &#92;(P&#95;p&#92;) not prime. Then &#92;(P&#92;) must have prime member.
