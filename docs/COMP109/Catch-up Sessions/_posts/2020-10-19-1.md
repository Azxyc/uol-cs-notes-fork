## Methods of Proof
* Counter Example Method
	* Prove that a statement is false by use of a counter-statement.
* Universal Proof
	* Applies to all integers e.g. odd if  \\(a=2k+1 \\)
	
## Example
 \\[(a+b)^2=a^2+b^2 \\]

Holds for:

* Some integers
* All integers
* No integers

The answer is that it holds for some integers as when  \\(a=0, \\ b=0 \\).  \\[ (0+0)^2=0^2+0^2 \\] This also follows for  \\(a \\neq0, \\ b=0 \\).

The two proofs I gave as answers to the question count for both a counter example proof and a universal proof.

## Example of Proof by Contradiction
Suppose for a proof by contradiction that  \\(P_n \\) is the largest prime number. Therefore,  \\(P_1 \\ldots P_n \\) are all the primes.

Consider  \\(P=P_1 \\times P_2 \\ldots P_n+1 \\)

Case 1:  \\(P_p \\) is prime

Case 2:  \\(P_p \\) not prime. Then  \\(P \\) must have prime member.
