## Example 1
$A=\\\{1,2,7,8,9\\\}, B=\\\{x\in A\vert x \text{ is odd}\\\}$

Where:

$C=A-B=A\cap B$

Therefore:

$B=\\\{1,7,9\\\}$

$C=\\\{2,8\\\} = \\\{x\in A \vert x \notin B\\\}$

## Proving Identities
To prove an identity you would consider the sections of a Venn diagram and consider each of the four cases. These cover all of the locations in the Venn diagram.
