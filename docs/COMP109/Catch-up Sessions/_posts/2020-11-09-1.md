## Example 1
&#92;(A=&#92;{1,2,7,8,9&#92;}, B=&#92;{x&#92;in A&#92;vert x &#92;text{ is odd}&#92;}&#92;)

Where:

&#92;(C=A-B=A&#92;cap B&#92;)

Therefore:

&#92;(B=&#92;{1,7,9&#92;}&#92;)

&#92;(C=&#92;{2,8&#92;} = &#92;{x&#92;in A &#92;vert x &#92;notin B&#92;}&#92;)

## Proving Identities
To prove an identity you would consider the sections of a Venn diagram and consider each of the four cases. These cover all of the locations in the Venn diagram.
