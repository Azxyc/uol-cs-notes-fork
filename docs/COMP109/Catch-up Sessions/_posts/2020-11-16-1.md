## Power Sets
The power set \\(\\text{Pow}\\{A\\}\\) of a set \\(A\\) is the set of all possible subsets. This includes the null set \\(\\emptyset\\) and the full set.

Each set in the power set follows this definition:

\\[\\{x\\vert x\\subseteq A\\}\\]

### Example
The power set \\(\\text{Pow}\\{A\\}\\) of a set \\(A=\\{1,2\\}\\) is:

\\[\\{\\emptyset,\\{1\\},\\{2\\},\\{1,2\\}\\}\\]

For any set \\(A\\):

\\[\\vert \\text{Pow(A)}\\vert =2^{\\vert A\\vert }\\]

Therefore: 

\\[\\{x\\vert x\\in\\text{Pow}(A)\\}=\\{\\emptyset,\\ldots\\}\\]

## Russell's Paradox
People say that you can define a set just by defining the constraints of the set:

\\[\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\vert x<4,x\\geq-1\\}\\]

However statements written in this way are susceptible to paradoxes. For example the following paradox:

Everyone from Crete is a liar. <cite>(Said by a person from Crete)</cite>

### Paradoxes in General
A paradox is a case that when expanded contains a contradiction.

## Avoiding Paradoxes
To avoid paradoxes we should write the set definition in the following way:

\\[\\{x\\in\\ldots\\vert \\ldots\\}\\]

This means that the set or value x should be taken from some other set.

They should not be written like this:

\\[\\{x\\ldots\\vert \\ldots\\}\\]

## Venn Diagrams and Set Logic

Draw the following as a Venn diagram: \\(A\\cap (B\\cup C)\\)
