## Power Sets
The power set {% raw %}\(\text{Pow}\{A\}\){% endraw %} of a set {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} is the set of all possible subsets. This includes the null set {% raw %}\(\emptyset\){% endraw %} and the full set.

Each set in the power set follows this definition:

{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}\{x\vert x\subseteq A\}\]

### Example
The power set {% raw %}\(\text{Pow}\{A\}\){% endraw %} of a set {% raw %}\(A=\{1,2\}\){% endraw %} is:

{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}\{\emptyset,\{1\},\{2\},\{1,2\}\}\]

For any set {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %}:

{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}\vert \text{Pow(A)}\vert =2^{\vert A\vert }\]

Therefore: 

{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}\{x\vert x\in\text{Pow}(A)\}=\{\emptyset,\ldots\}\]

## Russell's Paradox
People say that you can define a set just by defining the constraints of the set:

{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}\{x\in\mathbb{R}\vert x<4,x\geq-1\}\]

However statements written in this way are susceptible to paradoxes. For example the following paradox:

Everyone from Crete is a liar. <cite>(Said by a person from Crete)</cite>

### Paradoxes in General
A paradox is a case that when expanded contains a contradiction.

## Avoiding Paradoxes
To avoid paradoxes we should write the set definition in the following way:

{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}\{x\in\ldots\vert \ldots\}\]

This means that the set or value x should be taken from some other set.

They should not be written like this:

{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}\{x\ldots\vert \ldots\}\]

## Venn Diagrams and Set Logic

Draw the following as a Venn diagram: {% raw %}\(A\cap (B\cup C)\){% endraw %}
