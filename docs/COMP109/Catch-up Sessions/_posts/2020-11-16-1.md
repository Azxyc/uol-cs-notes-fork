## Power Sets
The power set \#92;(\#92;text{Pow}\#92;{A\#92;}\#92;) of a set \#92;(A\#92;) is the set of all possible subsets. This includes the null set \#92;(\#92;emptyset\#92;) and the full set.

Each set in the power set follows this definition:

\#92;[\#92;{x\#92;vert x\#92;subseteq A\#92;}\#92;]

### Example
The power set \#92;(\#92;text{Pow}\#92;{A\#92;}\#92;) of a set \#92;(A=\#92;{1,2\#92;}\#92;) is:

\#92;[\#92;{\#92;emptyset,\#92;{1\#92;},\#92;{2\#92;},\#92;{1,2\#92;}\#92;}\#92;]

For any set \#92;(A\#92;):

\#92;[\#92;vert \#92;text{Pow(A)}\#92;vert =2^{\#92;vert A\#92;vert }\#92;]

Therefore: 

\#92;[\#92;{x\#92;vert x\#92;in\#92;text{Pow}(A)\#92;}=\#92;{\#92;emptyset,\#92;ldots\#92;}\#92;]

## Russell's Paradox
People say that you can define a set just by defining the constraints of the set:

\#92;[\#92;{x\#92;in\#92;mathbb{R}\#92;vert x<4,x\#92;geq-1\#92;}\#92;]

However statements written in this way are susceptible to paradoxes. For example the following paradox:

Everyone from Crete is a liar. <cite>(Said by a person from Crete)</cite>

### Paradoxes in General
A paradox is a case that when expanded contains a contradiction.

## Avoiding Paradoxes
To avoid paradoxes we should write the set definition in the following way:

\#92;[\#92;{x\#92;in\#92;ldots\#92;vert \#92;ldots\#92;}\#92;]

This means that the set or value x should be taken from some other set.

They should not be written like this:

\#92;[\#92;{x\#92;ldots\#92;vert \#92;ldots\#92;}\#92;]

## Venn Diagrams and Set Logic
