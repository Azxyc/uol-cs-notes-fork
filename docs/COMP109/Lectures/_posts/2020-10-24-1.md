## Notion of Proof
### Types of Numbers
* Natural numbers &#92;(&#92;mathbb{N}&#92;) are whole numbers that start from 0.
* Integers are whole numbers including negatives.
* Rational numbers are any number that can be represented as fractions without a denominator of 0.
* Real numbers are any decimal number that can be presented on a number line. E.g. &#92;(&#92;pi&#92;)

### Proofs
A mathematical proof is a carefully reasoned argument to convince a sceptical listener that a statement is true.

## Properties of Odd and Even Numbers
An even number &#92;(m&#92;) is in the form &#92;(m = 2k&#92;) where &#92;(k&#92;) is an integer.

An odd number &#92;(n&#92;) is in the form &#92;(n= 2l+1&#92;) where &#92;(l&#92;) is an integer.

### Notation
* The symbol &#92;(&#92;exists&#92;) means exists.
* The symbol &#92;(&#92;Leftrightarrow&#92;) means if and only if. 
* The symbol &#92;(&#92;forall&#92;) means for all.

Some definitions written in notation may look like:

* &#92;(n&#92;) is even &#92;(&#92;Leftrightarrow &#92;exists&#92;)  an integer &#92;(k&#92;) such that &#92;(n=2k&#92;)

* &#92;(n&#92;) is odd &#92;(&#92;Leftrightarrow &#92;exists&#92;)  an integer &#92;(k&#92;) such that &#92;(n=2k+1&#92;)
