## Notion of Proof
### Types of Numbers
* Natural numbers {% raw %}\(\mathbb{N}\){% endraw %} are whole numbers that start from 0.
* Integers are whole numbers including negatives.
* Rational numbers are any number that can be represented as fractions without a denominator of 0.
* Real numbers are any decimal number that can be presented on a number line. E.g. {% raw %}\(\pi\){% endraw %}

### Proofs
A mathematical proof is a carefully reasoned argument to convince a sceptical listener that a statement is true.

## Properties of Odd and Even Numbers
An even number {% raw %}\(m\){% endraw %} is in the form {% raw %}\(m = 2k\){% endraw %} where {% raw %}\(k\){% endraw %} is an integer.

An odd number {% raw %}\(n\){% endraw %} is in the form {% raw %}\(n= 2l+1\){% endraw %} where {% raw %}\(l\){% endraw %} is an integer.

### Notation
* The symbol {% raw %}\(\exists\){% endraw %} means exists.
* The symbol {% raw %}\(\Leftrightarrow\){% endraw %} means if and only if. 
* The symbol {% raw %}\(\forall\){% endraw %} means for all.

Some definitions written in notation may look like:

* {% raw %}\(n\){% endraw %} is even {% raw %}\(\Leftrightarrow \exists\){% endraw %}  an integer {% raw %}\(k\){% endraw %} such that {% raw %}\(n=2k\){% endraw %}

* {% raw %}\(n\){% endraw %} is odd {% raw %}\(\Leftrightarrow \exists\){% endraw %}  an integer {% raw %}\(k\){% endraw %} such that {% raw %}\(n=2k+1\){% endraw %}
