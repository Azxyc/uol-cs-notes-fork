## Notion of Proof
### Types of Numbers
* Natural numbers \$$\mathbb{N}\$$ are whole numbers that start from 0.
* Integers are whole numbers including negatives.
* Rational numbers are any number that can be represented as fractions without a denominator of 0.
* Real numbers are any decimal number that can be presented on a number line. E.g. \$$\pi\$$

### Proofs
A mathematical proof is a carefully reasoned argument to convince a sceptical listener that a statement is true.

## Properties of Odd and Even Numbers
An even number \$$m\$$ is in the form \$$m = 2k\$$ where \$$k\$$ is an integer.

An odd number \$$n\$$ is in the form \$$n= 2l+1\$$ where \$$l\$$ is an integer.

### Notation
* The symbol \$$\exists\$$ means exists.
* The symbol \$$\Leftrightarrow\$$ means if and only if. 
* The symbol \$$\forall\$$ means for all.

Some definitions written in notation may look like:

* \$$n\$$ is even \$$\Leftrightarrow \exists\$$  an integer \$$k\$$ such that \$$n=2k\$$

* \$$n\$$ is odd \$$\Leftrightarrow \exists\$$  an integer \$$k\$$ such that \$$n=2k+1\$$
