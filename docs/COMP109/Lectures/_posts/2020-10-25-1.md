## Proving Existential Statements
An existential statement is a statement in the form: 
`{% raw %}\[\exists x\ Q(x)\]{% endraw %}`
This means that there exists a value to which the function `{% raw %}\(Q(x)\){% endraw %}` holds true. This may be under additional parameters.

The easiest way to prove this is to find an `{% raw %}\(x\){% endraw %}` that makes the function `{% raw %}\(Q(x)\){% endraw %}` true. Not all can be proved this way. 

### Examples
1. `{% raw %}\(\exists\){% endraw %}` an even integer `{% raw %}\(n\){% endraw %}` that can be written in two ways as a sum of two prime numbers. 
	`{% raw %}\[10=5+5=7+3\]{% endraw %}`
1. There `{% raw %}\(\exists\){% endraw %}` integers `{% raw %}\(m\){% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}\(n\){% endraw %}` such that `{% raw %}\(m>1\){% endraw %}`, `{% raw %}\(n>1\){% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}\(\frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n}\){% endraw %}` is an integer.
	`{% raw %}\[m=n=2\]{% endraw %}`
		Giving an example is a suitable proof.

## Proving Universal Statements
Generally proofs will require you to answer a universal statement rather than an existential one. an existential statement is of the form:
`{% raw %}\[\forall x \text{ if } P(x) \text{ then } Q(x)\]{% endraw %}`
This means that for all of `{% raw %}\(x\){% endraw %}` if one function is applied to `{% raw %}\(x\){% endraw %}` another function in `{% raw %}\(x\){% endraw %}` also holds true. For example:

If `{% raw %}\(a\){% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}\(b\){% endraw %}` are integers then `{% raw %}\(6a^2b\){% endraw %}` is even.

In this statement the "`{% raw %}\(a\){% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}\(b\){% endraw %}` are integers" count for `{% raw %}\(P(x)\){% endraw %}` and "`{% raw %}\(6a^2b\){% endraw %}` is even" counts for `{% raw %}\(Q(x)\){% endraw %}`. 

`{% raw %}\(6a^2b\){% endraw %}`  

`{% raw %}\(2(3a^2b)\){% endraw %}`

By halving you are proving that the answer is even as it is a multiple of two.

### Proof by Exhaustion
For theorems examining a relatively small number of examples you can test each value to see if the statement holds true. That is proof by exhaustion.

#### Example
* Prove that `{% raw %}\((n+1)^3 \geq 3^n\){% endraw %}` if `{% raw %}\(n\){% endraw %}` is a positive number.

As this theorem has such a small scope then each value can be tested to see if it is correct.

### Generalising from the Generic Particular
This method allows for using algebra and known rules to prove a statement generally.

#### Method
* Express the statement to be provided in the form `{% raw %}\(\forall x,\text{ if } P(x) \text{ then } Q(x)\){% endraw %}`
* Start the proof by supposing `{% raw %}\(x\){% endraw %}` is a particular by arbitrarily chosen element for which the hypothesis `{% raw %}\(P(x)\){% endraw %}` is true.
* Show that the conclusion `{% raw %}\(Q(x)\){% endraw %}` is true by using definitions, previously established results, and the rules for logical inference.

This method brings together definitions and facts into a conjecture.

### Example
Prove that the sum of any two even integers is even.

1. (Assume that/Suppose that) `{% raw %}\(m\){% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}\(n\){% endraw %}` are particular but arbitrarily chosen even integers.
1. As we assumed that `{% raw %}\(m\){% endraw %}` is an even integer, `{% raw %}\(m = 2k\){% endraw %}` for some integer `{% raw %}\(k\){% endraw %}`. 
1. Likewise `{% raw %}\(n\){% endraw %}` is an even integer, `{% raw %}\(n = 2l\){% endraw %}`, for some integer `{% raw %}\(l\){% endraw %}`
	* We cannot use the same letter again as `{% raw %}\(k\){% endraw %}` has already been used
1. Then `{% raw %}\(m+n=2k+2l=2(k+l)\){% endraw %}`, which is even as `{% raw %}\(k+l\){% endraw %}` is an integer.

The final step is called the conjecture as is aided by the previous steps to explain why the conjecture holds true.

### Disproving Universal Statement by Counterexample
To disprove a statement means to show that it is false. For example, for a statement such as:
`{% raw %}\[\forall x \text{ if } P(x) \text{ then } Q(x)\]{% endraw %}`
You are saying that the opposite is true:
`{% raw %}\[\exists x \text{ such that } P(x) \text{ and not } Q(x)\]{% endraw %}`

This means that you must give at least one example that disproves the universal statement.

#### Example
Is it true that for every positive integer `{% raw %}\(n,n^2\geq 2n\){% endraw %}`?

No as for `{% raw %}\(n=1,\ n^2 = 1\){% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}\(2n=2\){% endraw %}` which is greater than `{% raw %}\(n^2\){% endraw %}`
		
You can correct this by stipulating that for ever integer greater than one the statement holds true.
