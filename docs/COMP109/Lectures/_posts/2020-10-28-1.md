## Two Classic Results
These are classical proofs as they we're proven by the Ancient Greeks. They are both proofs by contradiction.

### Use proof by contradiction to show that there is no greatest prime number.
* 2, as the smallest prime number, is known as {% raw %}\(P_1\){% endraw %}. All following prime numbers are numbered sequentially.
* For each prime number that is identified any multiples are removed from the endless list of integers.
	* This is continued for {% raw %}\(P_2=3\){% endraw %} where all multiples of 3 are removed.
	
How do we know that at some point in the list all numbers are eliminated?

#### Proof
Assume for a proof by contradiction that there is a greatest prime number {% raw %}\(P_n\){% endraw %}.

Then {% raw %}\(P_1, P_2, \ldots , P_n\){% endraw %} are all prime numbers.

Consider {% raw %}\(P=P_1\times P_2\times \ldots \times P_{n+1}\){% endraw %}

Consider cases:

##### Case 1
{% raw %}\(P=P_1\times P_2\times \ldots \times P_{n+1}\){% endraw %} is prime. As {% raw %}\(P>P_n\){% endraw %} we derive a contradiction.

##### Case 2
{% raw %}\(P\){% endraw %} is not a prime. Then {% raw %}\(P\){% endraw %} has a divisor (all numbers can be expressed as a product of primes).

Then {% raw %}\(P\){% endraw %} has a prime factor.

So one of {% raw %}\(P_1, P_2, \ldots , P_n\){% endraw %} must divide {% raw %}\(P\){% endraw %}. This number can be called {% raw %}\(P_i\){% endraw %}. 

{% raw %}\(P=P_i\times Q,\ Q\neq 1\){% endraw %} 

{% raw %}\(P_1\times\ldots P_{n+1}=P_i\times Q\){% endraw %}

{% raw %}\(P_1\times\ldots P_{i-1} \times P_i \times P_{i+1} \times\ldots P_{n+1}=P_i\times Q\){% endraw %}

{% raw %}\(P_i \times Q - P_i (P_1 \times\ldots\times P_{i-1} \times P_{i+1} \times P_n)=1\){% endraw %}

{% raw %}\(P_i(Q-P_1 \times\ldots\times P_{i-1} \times P_{i+1} \times\ldots\times P_n) = 1\){% endraw %}

This is a contradiction as one is not a product of two distinct integers.

As a result the statement that there is no greatest prime number.

### Prove that {% raw %}\(\sqrt{2}\){% endraw %} is not a Rational Number
Assume for a proof by contradiction that {% raw %}\(\sqrt{2}\){% endraw %} is rational.

Then there exist integers {% raw %}\(m,n\){% endraw %} such that {% raw %}\(\sqrt{2}=\frac{m}{n}, n\neq 0, \frac{m}{n}\){% endraw %} is not reducible.

Then {% raw %}\((\sqrt{2})^2=(\frac{m}{n})^2\){% endraw %}. Then {% raw %}\(2=\frac{m^2}{n^2}\){% endraw %}.

Then {% raw %}\(2n^2=m^2\){% endraw %}. So {% raw %}\(m^2\){% endraw %} is even.

We already know that {% raw %}\(m\){% endraw %} must be even. 

By definition of even {% raw %}\(m=2k\){% endraw %} for some integer {% raw %}\(k\){% endraw %}. 

{% raw %}\(2n^2=m^2, m=2k\){% endraw %}

{% raw %}\(2m^2=(2k)^2\){% endraw %}. Then {% raw %}\(2n^2=4k^2\){% endraw %}. Then {% raw %}\(n^2=2k^2\){% endraw %}, so {% raw %}\(n^2\){% endraw %} is even. 

Then {% raw %}\(n\){% endraw %} is even.

So we derive a contradiction as n and m have a common factor of {% raw %}\(2\){% endraw %}. As it is reducible it doesn't follow the rule.

## Indirect Proof of Existential Statements
Prove that there exist irrational numbers {% raw %}\(q\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(r\){% endraw %} such that {% raw %}\(q^r\){% endraw %} is rational.

Consider Cases:

### Case 1
If {% raw %}\(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\){% endraw %} is a rational number then we are done and {% raw %}\(q=\sqrt2, r=\sqrt2\){% endraw %}.

### Case 2
{% raw %}\(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\){% endraw %} is not rational. Then:

{% raw %}\(q=\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}, r=\sqrt2\){% endraw %}

{% raw %}\(q^r = (\sqrt2^{\sqrt2})^{\sqrt2}=\sqrt2^{\sqrt2\sqrt2}=\sqrt2^2=2\){% endraw %}
