Using induction to show that a program is correct.
## Example on a Recursive Function that Generates Factorials
### Proof
By mathematical induction on \\(n\\).

#### Base Case \\(n=1\\)
\\[g(1)=1=1!\\]

#### Inductive Step
Suppose that for some \\(n=m, g(n)=n!\\)

Consider \\(n=m+1\\)

\\(g(m+1)\\) the code returns \\(g(m)\\times(m+1)\\)

By induction hypothesis, \\(g(m)=m!\\)

So: 
\\[g(m)\\times(m+1)=m!\\times(m+1)=(m+1)!\\]
