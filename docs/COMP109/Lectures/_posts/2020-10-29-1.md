Using induction to show that a program is correct.
## Example on a Recursive Function that Generates Factorials
### Proof
By mathematical induction on &#92;(n&#92;).

#### Base Case &#92;(n=1&#92;)
&#92;[g(1)=1=1!&#92;]

#### Inductive Step
Suppose that for some &#92;(n=m, g(n)=n!&#92;)

Consider &#92;(n=m+1&#92;)

&#92;(g(m+1)&#92;) the code returns &#92;(g(m)&#92;times(m+1)&#92;)

By induction hypothesis, &#92;(g(m)=m!&#92;)

So: 
&#92;[g(m)&#92;times(m+1)=m!&#92;times(m+1)=(m+1)!&#92;]
