For a normal case of mathematical induction you can prove that a statement holds for all numbers from a particular start point. 

It uses a base case so show that it holds for an individual number and an induction rule that proves that it holds for all numbers following.

* Prove that the property holds for the natural number {% raw %}\\\(n=0\\\){% endraw %}
* Prove that if the property holds for {% raw %}\\\(n=0,1,\ldots,m\\\){% endraw %} (and not just for m) then it holds for {% raw %}\\\(n=m+1\\\){% endraw %}.

Can also be used to prove a property for all integers greater than or equal to some particular natural number {% raw %}\\\(b\\\){% endraw %}.

## Example 1
Every natural number {% raw %}\\\(n \geq 2\\\){% endraw %}, is a prime or product of primes.

### Base Case
Take {% raw %}\\\(n=2\\\){% endraw %}

Then {% raw %}\\\(n\\\){% endraw %} is a prime number.

### Inductive Step
Assume that the property holds for {% raw %}\\\(n=m\\\){% endraw %} so every number {% raw %}\\\(i\\\){% endraw %} such that {% raw %}\\\(2\leq i\leq m\\\){% endraw %} is a prime or a product of primes. 

Now consider {% raw %}\\\(n=m+1\\\){% endraw %}.

We proceed by considering cases.

#### Case 1
{% raw %}\\\(m+1\\\){% endraw %} is prime.

There is nothing to prove.

#### Case 2
{% raw %}\\\(m+1\\\){% endraw %} is not prime.

So {% raw %}\\\(m+1=k\times l\\\){% endraw %}, where {% raw %}\\\(k\neq1,\ k\neq m+1\\\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\\\(l\neq 1,\ l\neq\ m+1\\\){% endraw %}

So {% raw %}\\\(k\geq2,\ l\geq2,\ k\leq m,\ l \leq m\\\){% endraw %}

So {% raw %}\\\(k=P_1\ldots P_n,\ l=Q_1\ldots Q_m\\\){% endraw %}. Then {% raw %}\\\(k\times l\\\){% endraw %} is a product of primes.

## Example 2
For any integer {% raw %}\\\(n\geq1\\\){% endraw %}, if {% raw %}\\\(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\\\){% endraw %} are {% raw %}\\\(n\\\){% endraw %} numbers, then no matter how the parentheses are inserted into their product, the number of multiplications used to compute the products is {% raw %}\\\(n-1\\\){% endraw %}.

As the number are all individual you can't use tricks like using already computed values to speed up the computation.

### Base Case
{% raw %}\\\[
X_1 \text{ for } n=1,\ n-1=0
\\\]{% endraw %}

### Induction Step
Suppose that no matter how I put parentheses on a sequence of {% raw %}\\\(i\\\){% endraw %} elements, where {% raw %}\\\(1\leq i\leq m\\\){% endraw %}, I need {% raw %}\\\(m-1\\\){% endraw %} multiplications. 

Consider, where {% raw %}\\\(1\leq l \leq m\\\){% endraw %}:
{% raw %}\\\[
\underbrace{\underbrace{(x_1\times\ldots)}_{l}\times\underbrace{(\ldots\times x_{m+1})}_{m+1-l}}_{m+1}
\\\]{% endraw %}

By induction hypothesis
{% raw %}\\\[\require{cancel}\cancel{l}-1+m+1-\cancel{l}-\cancel{1}+\cancel{1}=(m+1)-1\\\]{% endraw %}

This proves that the property holds for the next value to infinitude. {% raw %}\\\(\square\\\){% endraw %}
