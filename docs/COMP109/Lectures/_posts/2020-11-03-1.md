## Notation for Sets
A set is a collection of objects, called the elements of the set. 

* \$$\{7,5,3\}$$

We have written down the element of each set and contained them between the braces $$\{\}$$.

Repetitions and orderings don't matter in sets hence $$\{7,5,3\}$$ is the same as $$\{5,3,3,3,7\}$$. 

We write $$a\in A$$ to denote that the object $$a$$ is an element of the set $$a$$: $$7\in\{7,5,3\},4\notin\{7,5,3\}$$

The order of elements does not matter.

Repetitions don't count.

For a large set, especially an infinite set, we cannot write down all the elements. We use a **predicate** \$$P$$ instead.
$$A=\{x\in S\vert P(x)$$
denotes the set of objects $$x$$ from $$S$$ fro which the predicate $$P(x)$$ is true.

### Example
Let:
$$A = \{1,3,5,7,\ldots\}$$
Then:
$$A=\{x\in \mathbb{Z} \vert x \text{ is odd}\}$$

## More Examples
Find simpler descriptions of the following sets by listing their elements. (The set $$A$$ is written properly however $$B$$ and $$C$$ are written informally.

1. \$$A=\{x\in\mathbb{z}\vert x^2+4x=12\}$$

	$$\{2,-6\}$$
1. \$$B=\{n^2\vert n \text{ is an integer}\}$$

	$$\{0,1,4,9,16,25,\ldots\}$$
	
	$$B=\{m\in\mathbb{Z}\vert m=n^2 \text{ for some integer } n\}$$
	
1. \$$C=\{x\vert x \text{ a day of the week not containing "u"}\}$$
	
	$$\{\text{Monday, Wednesday, Friday}\}$$
	
## Important Sets
The empty set had no elements. It is written as $$\emptyset$$ or as $$\{\}$$. 

Here are some other sets:

* \$$\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,3,\ldots\}$$ The natural numbers.
* \$$\mathbb{Z}=\{\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\ldots\}$$ The integers.
* \$$\mathbb{Z^+}=\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$$ The positive integers.
* \$$\mathbb{Q}=\{\frac{x}{y}\vert x \in\mathbb{Z},y\in\mathbb{Z},y\neq0\}$$ The rationals.
* \$$\mathbb{R}$$ Real numbers.
	* \$$[a,b]=\{x\in\mathbb{R}\vert a\leq x \leq b\}$$ The set of real numbers between $$a$$ and $$b$$ inclusive.
	
## Computer Representation of Sets
Only finite sets can represented.

* Number of elements not fixed.
	* Lists
* All elements of $$A$$ are drawn from some ordered sequence $$S=\langle s_1,\ldots,s_n\rangle$$. The characteristic vector of $$A$$ is the sequence $$[b_1,\ldots,b_n]$$ where:
$$
    b_i=
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if}\ S_i\in A \\
      0 & \text{if}\ S_i\notin A
    \end{cases}
$$
* Sequences of zeros and ones of length $$n$$ are called bit strings of length $$n$$. These are also known as bit vectors or bit arrays.

### Examples
Let $$S\langle 1,2,3,4,5\rangle, A = \{1,3,5\}$$ and $$B=\{3,4\}$$

* Characteristic vectors show how sets relate to sequences. The $$1$$ shows that the value is in the set.
	* The characteristic vector of $$A$$ is $$[1,0,1,0,1]$$. 
	* The characteristic vector of $$B$$ is $$[0,0,1,1,0]$$.
	
* You would answer a question in the opposite direction like so:
	* The set characterised by $$[1,1,1,0,1]$$ is $$\{1,2,3,5\}$$.
	* The set characterised by $$[1,1,1,1,1]$$ is $$\{1,2,3,4,5\}$$.
	* The set characterised by $$[0,0,0,0,0]$$ is $$\emptyset$$.
