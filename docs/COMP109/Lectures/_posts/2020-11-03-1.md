## Notation for Sets
A set is a collection of objects, called the elements of the set. 

* &#92;(&#92;{7,5,3&#92;}&#92;)

We have written down the element of each set and contained them between the braces &#92;(&#92;{&#92;}&#92;).

Repetitions and orderings don't matter in sets hence &#92;(&#92;{7,5,3&#92;}&#92;) is the same as &#92;(&#92;{5,3,3,3,7&#92;}&#92;). 

We write &#92;(a\in A&#92;) to denote that the object &#92;(a&#92;) is an element of the set &#92;(a&#92;): &#92;[7\in&#92;{7,5,3&#92;},4\notin&#92;{7,5,3&#92;}&#92;]

The order of elements does not matter.

Repetitions don't count.

For a large set, especially an infinite set, we cannot write down all the elements. We use a **predicate** &#92;(P&#92;) instead.
&#92;[A=&#92;{x\in S\vert P(x)&#92;]
denotes the set of objects &#92;(x&#92;) from &#92;(S&#92;) fro which the predicate &#92;(P(x)&#92;) is true.

### Example
Let:
&#92;[A = &#92;{1,3,5,7,\ldots&#92;}&#92;]
Then:
&#92;[A=&#92;{x\in \mathbb{Z} \vert x \text{ is odd}&#92;}&#92;]

## More Examples
Find simpler descriptions of the following sets by listing their elements. (The set &#92;(A&#92;) is written properly however &#92;(B&#92;) and &#92;(C&#92;) are written informally.

1. &#92;(A=&#92;{x\in\mathbb{z}\vert x^2+4x=12&#92;}&#92;)

	&#92;(&#92;{2,-6&#92;}&#92;)
1. &#92;(B=&#92;{n^2\vert n \text{ is an integer}&#92;}&#92;)

	&#92;(&#92;{0,1,4,9,16,25,\ldots&#92;}&#92;)
	
	&#92;(B=&#92;{m\in\mathbb{Z}\vert m=n^2 \text{ for some integer } n&#92;}&#92;)
	
1. &#92;(C=&#92;{x\vert x \text{ a day of the week not containing "u"}&#92;}&#92;)
	
	&#92;(&#92;{\text{Monday, Wednesday, Friday}&#92;}&#92;)
	
## Important Sets
The empty set had no elements. It is written as &#92;(\emptyset&#92;) or as &#92;(&#92;{&#92;}&#92;). 

Here are some other sets:

* &#92;(\mathbb{N}=&#92;{0,1,2,3,\ldots&#92;}&#92;) The natural numbers.
* &#92;(\mathbb{Z}=&#92;{\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\ldots&#92;}&#92;) The integers.
* &#92;(\mathbb{Z^+}=&#92;{1,2,3,\ldots&#92;}&#92;) The positive integers.
* &#92;(\mathbb{Q}=&#92;{\frac{x}{y}\vert x \in\mathbb{Z},y\in\mathbb{Z},y\neq0&#92;}&#92;) The rationals.
* &#92;(\mathbb{R}&#92;) Real numbers.
	* &#92;([a,b]=&#92;{x\in\mathbb{R}\vert a\leq x \leq b&#92;}&#92;) The set of real numbers between &#92;(a&#92;) and &#92;(b&#92;) inclusive.
	
## Computer Representation of Sets
Only finite sets can represented.

* Number of elements not fixed.
	* Lists
* All elements of &#92;(A&#92;) are drawn from some ordered sequence &#92;(S=\langle s&#95;1,\ldots,s&#95;n\rangle&#92;). The characteristic vector of &#92;(A&#92;) is the sequence &#92;([b&#95;1,\ldots,b&#95;n]&#92;) where:
&#92;[
    b&#95;i=
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if}\ S&#95;i\in A &#92;&#92;
      0 & \text{if}\ S&#95;i\notin A
    \end{cases}
&#92;]
* Sequences of zeros and ones of length &#92;(n&#92;) are called bit strings of length &#92;(n&#92;). These are also known as bit vectors or bit arrays.

### Examples
Let &#92;(S\langle 1,2,3,4,5\rangle, A = &#92;{1,3,5&#92;}&#92;) and &#92;(B=&#92;{3,4&#92;}&#92;)

* Characteristic vectors show how sets relate to sequences. The &#92;(1&#92;) shows that the value is in the set.
	* The characteristic vector of &#92;(A&#92;) is &#92;([1,0,1,0,1]&#92;). 
	* The characteristic vector of &#92;(B&#92;) is &#92;([0,0,1,1,0]&#92;).
	
* You would answer a question in the opposite direction like so:
	* The set characterised by &#92;([1,1,1,0,1]&#92;) is &#92;(&#92;{1,2,3,5&#92;}&#92;).
	* The set characterised by &#92;([1,1,1,1,1]&#92;) is &#92;(&#92;{1,2,3,4,5&#92;}&#92;).
	* The set characterised by &#92;([0,0,0,0,0]&#92;) is &#92;(\emptyset&#92;).
