## Notation for Sets
A set is a collection of objects, called the elements of the set. 

* {% raw %}\(\{7,5,3\}\){% endraw %}

We have written down the element of each set and contained them between the braces {% raw %}\(\{\}\){% endraw %}.

Repetitions and orderings don't matter in sets hence {% raw %}\(\{7,5,3\}\){% endraw %} is the same as {% raw %}\(\{5,3,3,3,7\}\){% endraw %}. 

We write {% raw %}\(a\in A\){% endraw %} to denote that the object {% raw %}\(a\){% endraw %} is an element of the set {% raw %}\(a\){% endraw %}: {% raw %}\]{% endraw %}7\in\{7,5,3\},4\notin\{7,5,3\}\]

The order of elements does not matter.

Repetitions don't count.

For a large set, especially an infinite set, we cannot write down all the elements. We use a **predicate** {% raw %}\(P\){% endraw %} instead.
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}A=\{x\in S\vert P(x)\]
denotes the set of objects {% raw %}\(x\){% endraw %} from {% raw %}\(S\){% endraw %} fro which the predicate {% raw %}\(P(x)\){% endraw %} is true.

### Example
Let:
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}A = \{1,3,5,7,\ldots\}\]
Then:
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}A=\{x\in \mathbb{Z} \vert x \text{ is odd}\}\]

## More Examples
Find simpler descriptions of the following sets by listing their elements. (The set {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} is written properly however {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(C\){% endraw %} are written informally.

1. {% raw %}\(A=\{x\in\mathbb{z}\vert x^2+4x=12\}\){% endraw %}

	{% raw %}\(\{2,-6\}\){% endraw %}
1. {% raw %}\(B=\{n^2\vert n \text{ is an integer}\}\){% endraw %}

	{% raw %}\(\{0,1,4,9,16,25,\ldots\}\){% endraw %}
	
	{% raw %}\(B=\{m\in\mathbb{Z}\vert m=n^2 \text{ for some integer } n\}\){% endraw %}
	
1. {% raw %}\(C=\{x\vert x \text{ a day of the week not containing "u"}\}\){% endraw %}
	
	{% raw %}\(\{\text{Monday, Wednesday, Friday}\}\){% endraw %}
	
## Important Sets
The empty set had no elements. It is written as {% raw %}\(\emptyset\){% endraw %} or as {% raw %}\(\{\}\){% endraw %}. 

Here are some other sets:

* {% raw %}\(\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,3,\ldots\}\){% endraw %} The natural numbers.
* {% raw %}\(\mathbb{Z}=\{\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\ldots\}\){% endraw %} The integers.
* {% raw %}\(\mathbb{Z^+}=\{1,2,3,\ldots\}\){% endraw %} The positive integers.
* {% raw %}\(\mathbb{Q}=\{\frac{x}{y}\vert x \in\mathbb{Z},y\in\mathbb{Z},y\neq0\}\){% endraw %} The rationals.
* {% raw %}\(\mathbb{R}\){% endraw %} Real numbers.
	* {% raw %}\([a,b]=\{x\in\mathbb{R}\vert a\leq x \leq b\}\){% endraw %} The set of real numbers between {% raw %}\(a\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(b\){% endraw %} inclusive.
	
## Computer Representation of Sets
Only finite sets can represented.

* Number of elements not fixed.
	* Lists
* All elements of {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} are drawn from some ordered sequence {% raw %}\(S=\langle s_1,\ldots,s_n\rangle\){% endraw %}. The characteristic vector of {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} is the sequence {% raw %}\([b_1,\ldots,b_n]\){% endraw %} where:
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}
    b_i=
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if}\ S_i\in A \\
      0 & \text{if}\ S_i\notin A
    \end{cases}
\]
* Sequences of zeros and ones of length {% raw %}\(n\){% endraw %} are called bit strings of length {% raw %}\(n\){% endraw %}. These are also known as bit vectors or bit arrays.

### Examples
Let {% raw %}\(S\langle 1,2,3,4,5\rangle, A = \{1,3,5\}\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(B=\{3,4\}\){% endraw %}

* Characteristic vectors show how sets relate to sequences. The {% raw %}\(1\){% endraw %} shows that the value is in the set.
	* The characteristic vector of {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} is {% raw %}\([1,0,1,0,1]\){% endraw %}. 
	* The characteristic vector of {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} is {% raw %}\([0,0,1,1,0]\){% endraw %}.
	
* You would answer a question in the opposite direction like so:
	* The set characterised by {% raw %}\([1,1,1,0,1]\){% endraw %} is {% raw %}\(\{1,2,3,5\}\){% endraw %}.
	* The set characterised by {% raw %}\([1,1,1,1,1]\){% endraw %} is {% raw %}\(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\){% endraw %}.
	* The set characterised by {% raw %}\([0,0,0,0,0]\){% endraw %} is {% raw %}\(\emptyset\){% endraw %}.
