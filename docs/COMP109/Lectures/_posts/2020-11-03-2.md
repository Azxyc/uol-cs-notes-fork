## Subsets
A set {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} is called a subset of a set {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} if every element of {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} is an element of {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %}. This is denoted by {% raw %}\(B\subseteq A\){% endraw %}.

### Examples
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}\{3,4,5\}\subseteq\{1,5,4,2,1,3\},\ \{3,3,5\}\subseteq\{3,5\},\ \{5,3\}\subseteq\{3,5\}\]


```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph A
    B(B)
    end
```
*Venn diagram of {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} subset {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %}.*

Therefore, {% raw %}\(\forall\){% endraw %} sets {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %}, {% raw %}\(A\subseteq A\){% endraw %}
{:.info}

Furthermore, {% raw %}\(\emptyset\subseteq A\){% endraw %} is always true. This is as the empty set is always a subset of any other set including the empty set itself.

#### Subsets in Python
In programming languages such as python you can save on writing out a function to fund whether a set is a subset of another set. To do this you can use the `<` symbol in place of the {% raw %}\(\subseteq\){% endraw %} symbol:

```python
print n<m
```

Where `n` and `m` are both sets.

### Subsets and Bit Vectors Example
Let {% raw %}\(S=\langle1,2,3,4,5\rangle,A=\{1,3,5\}\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(B=\{3,4\}\){% endraw %}.

* Is {% raw %}\(A\subseteq B\){% endraw %}?

	{% raw %}\(x_a=[1,0,1,0,1]\){% endraw %}  
	{% raw %}\(x_b=[0,0,1,1,0]\){% endraw %}
	
	Therefore {% raw %}\(A\nsubseteq B\){% endraw %}. As you can see from the aligned bits. Not all the bits present in {% raw %}\(x_b\){% endraw %} are present in {% raw %}\(x_a\){% endraw %}.

* Is the set {% raw %}\(C\){% endraw %}, represented by {% raw %}\([1,0,0,0,1]\){% endraw %}, a subset  of the set {% raw %}\(D\){% endraw %}, represented by {% raw %}\([1,1,0,0,1]\){% endraw %}?
	
	{% raw %}\(C\subseteq D\){% endraw %} as all bits present in the bit vector of {% raw %}\(C\){% endraw %} are also present in the bit vector of {% raw %}\(D\){% endraw %}.
	
## Equality
As covered before a set {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} is called equal to a set {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} if {% raw %}\(A\subseteq B\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(B\subseteq A\){% endraw %}. This is denoted by {% raw %}\(A=B\){% endraw %}.

This is to say that if two sets are subsets of each other then they are equal.

### Confirming Equality
Let {% raw %}\(S=\langle1,2,3,4,5\rangle,A=\{1,3,5\}\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(B=\{3,4\}\){% endraw %}.

#### Is {% raw %}\(A=B\){% endraw %}?
{% raw %}\(x_a=[1,0,1,0,1]\){% endraw %}  
{% raw %}\(x_b=[0,0,1,1,0]\){% endraw %}

Therefore {% raw %}\(A\neq B\){% endraw %} as the bit vectors do not match.
