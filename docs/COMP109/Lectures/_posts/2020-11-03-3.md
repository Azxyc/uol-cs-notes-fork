## Union
The union of two sets &#92;(A&#92;) and &#92;(B&#92;) is the set: 
&#92;[A\cup B = \{x\vert x\in A\ \text{or} \in B\}&#92;]

This is the same as logical OR (&#92;(+&#92;))

### Example  
Suppose
&#92;[A=\{4,7,8\},\ B=\{4,9,10\}&#92;] 
Then
&#92;[A\cup B = \{4,7,8,9,10\}&#92;]

In bit vectors you just perform a logical OR on both of the bit vectors. The result of the OR is the bit vector of the result of the union.

## Intersection
The intersection of two sets &#92;(A&#92;) and &#92;(B&#92;) is the set:
&#92;[A\cap B = \{x\vert x\in A\ \text{and}\ x\in B\}&#92;]

This is the same as logical AND.

### Example
Suppose
&#92;[A=\{4,7,8\},\ B=\{4,9,10\}&#92;] 
Then
&#92;[A\cap B = \{4\}&#92;]

In bit vectors the result of the intersection is the same as a logical AND on the bit vectors.

## Relative Complement
The relative complement of a set &#92;(B&#92;) to a set &#92;(A&#92;) is the set:
&#92;[A-B=\{x\vert x\in A\ \text{and}\ x\notin B\}&#92;]

This is the same as XOR (&#92;(\oplus&#92;))

This is also sometimes called the set difference.
### Example  
Suppose
&#92;[A=\{4,7,8\},\ B=\{4,9,10\}&#92;] 
Then
&#92;[A - B = \{7,8\}&#92;]

In bit vectors perform an XOR on both of the bit vectors to get the result.

## Complement
When we are dealing with subsets of some large set &#92;(U&#92;), then we call &#92;(U&#92;) the universal set fro the problem in question.

The complement of a set &#92;(A&#92;) is the set:
&#92;[\sim A=\{x\vert x\notin A\}=U-A&#92;]

This is the same as a binary NOT &#92;(\neg&#92;).

### Example
Let
&#92;[S=\langle1,2,3,4,5\rangle,\ A=\{1,3,5\}&#92;]
Then
&#92;[\sim A = \{2,4\}&#92;]

## The Symmetric Difference
The symmetric difference of two sets &#92;(A&#92;) and &#92;(B&#92;) is the set:
&#92;[A\Delta B=\{x\vert (x\in A\ \text{and}\ x \notin B)\ \text{or}\ (x\notin A\ \text{and}\ x \notin B)\} &#92;]

This is the same as the logical operator NAND.

### Example  
Suppose
&#92;[A=\{4,7,8\},\ B=\{4,9,10\}&#92;] 
Then
&#92;[A - B = \{7,8,9,10\}&#92;]

In bit vectors perform an NAND on both of the bit vectors to get the result.

### Proving the Identity of &#92;(A\Delta B=(A\cup B)-(A\cap B)&#92;)
#### Proof
Suppose that &#92;(x&#92;) is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element. Consider all cases of this element:

##### Case 1
&#92;(x\notin A,\ x\notin B&#92;). By definition of &#92;(\Delta,\ x\notin A\Delta B&#92;).

By definition of &#92;(\cup,\ x\notin A\cup B&#92;).

Hence &#92;((A\cup B)-(A\cap B)&#92;).

##### Case 2
&#92;(x\in A,\ x\notin B&#92;). By definition of &#92;(\Delta,\ x\in A\Delta B&#92;)

By definition of &#92;(\cup,\ x\in A\cup B&#92;) as &#92;(x\in A&#92;). 

As &#92;(x\notin B,\ x\notin A\cap B&#92;). 

So &#92;(x\in(A\cup B)-(A\cap B)&#92;).

##### Case 3
&#92;(x\notin A,\ x\in B&#92;). This case is symmetric to case 2.

##### Case 4
&#92;(x\in A,\ x\in B&#92;). By definition of &#92;(\Delta,\ x\notin A\Delta B&#92;).

As &#92;(x\in A&#92;), by definition of &#92;(\cup,\ x\in A\cup B&#92;).

As &#92;(x\in A,\ x\in B,\ x\in A\cap B&#92;).

So &#92;(x\notin (A\cup B)-(A\cap B)&#92;).

By the generalisation from the generic particular principle, the identity holds.

(As both sides are equal for all cases the identity must be valid.)
