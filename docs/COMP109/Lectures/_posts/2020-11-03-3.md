## Union
The union of two sets &#92;(A&#92;) and &#92;(B&#92;) is the set: 
&#92;[A&#92;cup B = &#92;{x&#92;vert x&#92;in A&#92; &#92;text{or} &#92;in B&#92;}&#92;]

This is the same as logical OR (&#92;(+&#92;))

### Example  
Suppose
&#92;[A=&#92;{4,7,8&#92;},&#92; B=&#92;{4,9,10&#92;}&#92;] 
Then
&#92;[A&#92;cup B = &#92;{4,7,8,9,10&#92;}&#92;]

In bit vectors you just perform a logical OR on both of the bit vectors. The result of the OR is the bit vector of the result of the union.

## Intersection
The intersection of two sets &#92;(A&#92;) and &#92;(B&#92;) is the set:
&#92;[A&#92;cap B = &#92;{x&#92;vert x&#92;in A&#92; &#92;text{and}&#92; x&#92;in B&#92;}&#92;]

This is the same as logical AND.

### Example
Suppose
&#92;[A=&#92;{4,7,8&#92;},&#92; B=&#92;{4,9,10&#92;}&#92;] 
Then
&#92;[A&#92;cap B = &#92;{4&#92;}&#92;]

In bit vectors the result of the intersection is the same as a logical AND on the bit vectors.

## Relative Complement
The relative complement of a set &#92;(B&#92;) to a set &#92;(A&#92;) is the set:
&#92;[A-B=&#92;{x&#92;vert x&#92;in A&#92; &#92;text{and}&#92; x&#92;notin B&#92;}&#92;]

This is the same as XOR (&#92;(&#92;oplus&#92;))

This is also sometimes called the set difference.
### Example  
Suppose
&#92;[A=&#92;{4,7,8&#92;},&#92; B=&#92;{4,9,10&#92;}&#92;] 
Then
&#92;[A - B = &#92;{7,8&#92;}&#92;]

In bit vectors perform an XOR on both of the bit vectors to get the result.

## Complement
When we are dealing with subsets of some large set &#92;(U&#92;), then we call &#92;(U&#92;) the universal set fro the problem in question.

The complement of a set &#92;(A&#92;) is the set:
&#92;[&#92;sim A=&#92;{x&#92;vert x&#92;notin A&#92;}=U-A&#92;]

This is the same as a binary NOT &#92;(&#92;neg&#92;).

### Example
Let
&#92;[S=&#92;langle1,2,3,4,5&#92;rangle,&#92; A=&#92;{1,3,5&#92;}&#92;]
Then
&#92;[&#92;sim A = &#92;{2,4&#92;}&#92;]

## The Symmetric Difference
The symmetric difference of two sets &#92;(A&#92;) and &#92;(B&#92;) is the set:
&#92;[A&#92;Delta B=&#92;{x&#92;vert (x&#92;in A&#92; &#92;text{and}&#92; x &#92;notin B)&#92; &#92;text{or}&#92; (x&#92;notin A&#92; &#92;text{and}&#92; x &#92;notin B)&#92;} &#92;]

This is the same as the logical operator NAND.

### Example  
Suppose
&#92;[A=&#92;{4,7,8&#92;},&#92; B=&#92;{4,9,10&#92;}&#92;] 
Then
&#92;[A - B = &#92;{7,8,9,10&#92;}&#92;]

In bit vectors perform an NAND on both of the bit vectors to get the result.

### Proving the Identity of &#92;(A&#92;Delta B=(A&#92;cup B)-(A&#92;cap B)&#92;)
#### Proof
Suppose that &#92;(x&#92;) is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element. Consider all cases of this element:

##### Case 1
&#92;(x&#92;notin A,&#92; x&#92;notin B&#92;). By definition of &#92;(&#92;Delta,&#92; x&#92;notin A&#92;Delta B&#92;).

By definition of &#92;(&#92;cup,&#92; x&#92;notin A&#92;cup B&#92;).

Hence &#92;((A&#92;cup B)-(A&#92;cap B)&#92;).

##### Case 2
&#92;(x&#92;in A,&#92; x&#92;notin B&#92;). By definition of &#92;(&#92;Delta,&#92; x&#92;in A&#92;Delta B&#92;)

By definition of &#92;(&#92;cup,&#92; x&#92;in A&#92;cup B&#92;) as &#92;(x&#92;in A&#92;). 

As &#92;(x&#92;notin B,&#92; x&#92;notin A&#92;cap B&#92;). 

So &#92;(x&#92;in(A&#92;cup B)-(A&#92;cap B)&#92;).

##### Case 3
&#92;(x&#92;notin A,&#92; x&#92;in B&#92;). This case is symmetric to case 2.

##### Case 4
&#92;(x&#92;in A,&#92; x&#92;in B&#92;). By definition of &#92;(&#92;Delta,&#92; x&#92;notin A&#92;Delta B&#92;).

As &#92;(x&#92;in A&#92;), by definition of &#92;(&#92;cup,&#92; x&#92;in A&#92;cup B&#92;).

As &#92;(x&#92;in A,&#92; x&#92;in B,&#92; x&#92;in A&#92;cap B&#92;).

So &#92;(x&#92;notin (A&#92;cup B)-(A&#92;cap B)&#92;).

By the generalisation from the generic particular principle, the identity holds.

(As both sides are equal for all cases the identity must be valid.)
