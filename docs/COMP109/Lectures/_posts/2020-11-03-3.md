## Union
The union of two sets {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} is the set: 
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}A\cup B = \{x\vert x\in A\ \text{or} \in B\}\]

This is the same as logical OR ({% raw %}\(+\){% endraw %})

### Example  
Suppose
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}A=\{4,7,8\},\ B=\{4,9,10\}\] 
Then
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}A\cup B = \{4,7,8,9,10\}\]

In bit vectors you just perform a logical OR on both of the bit vectors. The result of the OR is the bit vector of the result of the union.

## Intersection
The intersection of two sets {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} is the set:
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}A\cap B = \{x\vert x\in A\ \text{and}\ x\in B\}\]

This is the same as logical AND.

### Example
Suppose
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}A=\{4,7,8\},\ B=\{4,9,10\}\] 
Then
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}A\cap B = \{4\}\]

In bit vectors the result of the intersection is the same as a logical AND on the bit vectors.

## Relative Complement
The relative complement of a set {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} to a set {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} is the set:
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}A-B=\{x\vert x\in A\ \text{and}\ x\notin B\}\]

This is the same as XOR ({% raw %}\(\oplus\){% endraw %})

This is also sometimes called the set difference.
### Example  
Suppose
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}A=\{4,7,8\},\ B=\{4,9,10\}\] 
Then
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}A - B = \{7,8\}\]

In bit vectors perform an XOR on both of the bit vectors to get the result.

## Complement
When we are dealing with subsets of some large set {% raw %}\(U\){% endraw %}, then we call {% raw %}\(U\){% endraw %} the universal set fro the problem in question.

The complement of a set {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} is the set:
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}\sim A=\{x\vert x\notin A\}=U-A\]

This is the same as a binary NOT {% raw %}\(\neg\){% endraw %}.

### Example
Let
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}S=\langle1,2,3,4,5\rangle,\ A=\{1,3,5\}\]
Then
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}\sim A = \{2,4\}\]

## The Symmetric Difference
The symmetric difference of two sets {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} is the set:
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}A\Delta B=\{x\vert (x\in A\ \text{and}\ x \notin B)\ \text{or}\ (x\notin A\ \text{and}\ x \notin B)\} \]

This is the same as the logical operator NAND.

### Example  
Suppose
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}A=\{4,7,8\},\ B=\{4,9,10\}\] 
Then
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}A - B = \{7,8,9,10\}\]

In bit vectors perform an NAND on both of the bit vectors to get the result.

### Proving the Identity of {% raw %}\(A\Delta B=(A\cup B)-(A\cap B)\){% endraw %}
#### Proof
Suppose that {% raw %}\(x\){% endraw %} is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element. Consider all cases of this element:

##### Case 1
{% raw %}\(x\notin A,\ x\notin B\){% endraw %}. By definition of {% raw %}\(\Delta,\ x\notin A\Delta B\){% endraw %}.

By definition of {% raw %}\(\cup,\ x\notin A\cup B\){% endraw %}.

Hence {% raw %}\((A\cup B)-(A\cap B)\){% endraw %}.

##### Case 2
{% raw %}\(x\in A,\ x\notin B\){% endraw %}. By definition of {% raw %}\(\Delta,\ x\in A\Delta B\){% endraw %}

By definition of {% raw %}\(\cup,\ x\in A\cup B\){% endraw %} as {% raw %}\(x\in A\){% endraw %}. 

As {% raw %}\(x\notin B,\ x\notin A\cap B\){% endraw %}. 

So {% raw %}\(x\in(A\cup B)-(A\cap B)\){% endraw %}.

##### Case 3
{% raw %}\(x\notin A,\ x\in B\){% endraw %}. This case is symmetric to case 2.

##### Case 4
{% raw %}\(x\in A,\ x\in B\){% endraw %}. By definition of {% raw %}\(\Delta,\ x\notin A\Delta B\){% endraw %}.

As {% raw %}\(x\in A\){% endraw %}, by definition of {% raw %}\(\cup,\ x\in A\cup B\){% endraw %}.

As {% raw %}\(x\in A,\ x\in B,\ x\in A\cap B\){% endraw %}.

So {% raw %}\(x\notin (A\cup B)-(A\cap B)\){% endraw %}.

By the generalisation from the generic particular principle, the identity holds.

(As both sides are equal for all cases the identity must be valid.)
