The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set. The notation for this is &#92;(\vert A\vert&#92;) where &#92;(A&#92;) is a set to be counted.

## Power Set and Bit Vectors
We use the correspondence between bit vectors and subsets: &#92;(\left\vert  \text{\textit{Pow}}(A)\right\vert&#92;) is the number of bit vectors of length &#92;(n&#92;).

&#92;[A\ s.t \left\vert  A \right\vert  = n,\ S_n = \langle\ldots\rangle&#92;]

&#92;[B \subseteq A \rightarrow X_b = \underbrace{\left[\frac{0}{1},\ldots,\frac{0}{1}\right]}_n&#92;]

A bit vector of the set &#92;(C&#92;) is represented by the vector &#92;(X_C&#92;):

&#92;[X_c=\left[\ldots\right] \rightarrow C&#92;]

This means that provided you know the set you and reconstruct a subset from the bit vector of that subset.

## The Number of &#92;(n&#92;)-bit vectors in &#92;(2^n&#92;)
We prove the statement by induction
### Base Case:
&#92;(n=1&#92;)

There are two bit vectors of length 1:

&#92;(\left[0\right], \left[1\right]&#92;)

&#92;(2^1=2&#92;)

### Inductive Step:
Assume that the property holds for &#92;(n=m&#92;), so the number of &#92;(m&#92;)-bit vectors is &#92;(2^m&#92;). Now consider the set &#92;(B&#92;) of all &#92;((m+1)&#92;)-bit vectors. We must show that &#92;(\left\vert B\right\vert =2^{m+1}&#92;).

We know that all elements of &#92;(B&#92;) are bit vectors of length &#92;(m+1&#92;):

&#92;[\underbrace{\left[\hspace{0.5cm},\right]}_{m+1}\in B&#92;]

The first elements apart from the last one are put in a new bit vector:

&#92;[\underbrace{\left[\ldots\right]}_m&#92;]

Given any bit vector there are only two ways of filling in the last value, with a 0 or a 1. As there are two ways of extending a bit vector then you times the bit vector by two.

&#92;[\left\vert  B \right\vert  = 2 \times 2^m = 2^{m+1}&#92;]

## Computing the Cardinality of a Union of Two Sets
If &#92;(A&#92;) and &#92;(B&#92;) are sets then:

&#92;[\left\vert  A \cup B \right\vert  = \left\vert  A \right\vert  + \left\vert  B \right\vert  - \left\vert  A\cap B \right\vert &#92;]

### Example
Suppose there are 100 third-year students. 40 of them take the module "Sequential Algorithms" and 80 of them take the module "Multi-Agent Systems". 25 of them took both modules. How many students took neither modules?

&#92;(S=&#92;{s\in \text{Student} \vert  s \text{ takes Seq. Alg.}&#92;}&#92;)  
&#92;(M=&#92;{s\in \text{Student} \vert  s \text{ takes Mult. Agent Systems}&#92;}&#92;)

* &#92;(\vert \text{Students}\vert  =100&#92;)
* &#92;(\vert S\vert =40&#92;)
* &#92;(\vert M\vert  = 80&#92;)
* &#92;(\vert S\cap M\vert  =25&#92;)

&#92;(40+80-25=95=\vert S\cup M\vert &#92;)
&#92;(\vert \sim(S\cup M)\vert =100-95=5&#92;)

Therefore, 5 students took neither as they were part of the universal set but not part of the union of the two subsets.

## Computing the Cardinality of a Union of Three Sets
If &#92;(A&#92;), &#92;(B&#92;) and &#92;(C&#92;) are sets then:

&#92;[\vert A\cup B \cup C\vert = \vert A\vert  +\vert B\vert  + \vert C\vert  - \vert A\cap B\vert -\vert A\cap C\vert  - \vert B\cap C\vert  + \vert A\cap B\cap C\vert &#92;]

This and the last union are special cases of the **principle of inclusion and exclusion**.

## Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion
Let &#92;(A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n&#92;) be sets.

Then:

&#92;[\left\vert A_1\cup\ldots\cup A_n\right\vert =\sum_{1\leq k\leq n} \left\vert A_i\right\vert -\sum_{1\leq j\leq k\leq n} \left\vert A_j \cap A_k\right\vert +\sum_{1\leq i\leq j\leq k\leq n} \left\vert A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k\right\vert &#92;]
&#92;[-...+(-1)^{n-1}\left\vert A_1\cap\ldots\cap A_n\right\vert &#92;]
