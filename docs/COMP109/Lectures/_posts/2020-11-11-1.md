The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set. The notation for this is \#92;(\#92;vert A\#92;vert\#92;) where \#92;(A\#92;) is a set to be counted.

## Power Set and Bit Vectors
We use the correspondence between bit vectors and subsets: \#92;(\#92;left\#92;vert  \#92;text{\#92;textit{Pow}}(A)\#92;right\#92;vert\#92;) is the number of bit vectors of length \#92;(n\#92;).

\#92;[A\#92; s.t \#92;left\#92;vert  A \#92;right\#92;vert  = n,\#92; S_n = \#92;langle\#92;ldots\#92;rangle\#92;]

\#92;[B \#92;subseteq A \#92;rightarrow X_b = \#92;underbrace{\#92;left[\#92;frac{0}{1},\#92;ldots,\#92;frac{0}{1}\#92;right]}_n\#92;]

A bit vector of the set \#92;(C\#92;) is represented by the vector \#92;(X_C\#92;):

\#92;[X_c=\#92;left[\#92;ldots\#92;right] \#92;rightarrow C\#92;]

This means that provided you know the set you and reconstruct a subset from the bit vector of that subset.

## The Number of \#92;(n\#92;)-bit vectors in \#92;(2^n\#92;)
We prove the statement by induction
### Base Case:
\#92;(n=1\#92;)

There are two bit vectors of length 1:

\#92;(\#92;left[0\#92;right], \#92;left[1\#92;right]\#92;)

\#92;(2^1=2\#92;)

### Inductive Step:
Assume that the property holds for \#92;(n=m\#92;), so the number of \#92;(m\#92;)-bit vectors is \#92;(2^m\#92;). Now consider the set \#92;(B\#92;) of all \#92;((m+1)\#92;)-bit vectors. We must show that \#92;(\#92;left\#92;vert B\#92;right\#92;vert =2^{m+1}\#92;).

We know that all elements of \#92;(B\#92;) are bit vectors of length \#92;(m+1\#92;):

\#92;[\#92;underbrace{\#92;left[\#92;hspace{0.5cm},\#92;right]}_{m+1}\#92;in B\#92;]

The first elements apart from the last one are put in a new bit vector:

\#92;[\#92;underbrace{\#92;left[\#92;ldots\#92;right]}_m\#92;]

Given any bit vector there are only two ways of filling in the last value, with a 0 or a 1. As there are two ways of extending a bit vector then you times the bit vector by two.

\#92;[\#92;left\#92;vert  B \#92;right\#92;vert  = 2 \#92;times 2^m = 2^{m+1}\#92;]

## Computing the Cardinality of a Union of Two Sets
If \#92;(A\#92;) and \#92;(B\#92;) are sets then:

\#92;[\#92;left\#92;vert  A \#92;cup B \#92;right\#92;vert  = \#92;left\#92;vert  A \#92;right\#92;vert  + \#92;left\#92;vert  B \#92;right\#92;vert  - \#92;left\#92;vert  A\#92;cap B \#92;right\#92;vert \#92;]

### Example
Suppose there are 100 third-year students. 40 of them take the module "Sequential Algorithms" and 80 of them take the module "Multi-Agent Systems". 25 of them took both modules. How many students took neither modules?

\#92;(S=\#92;{s\#92;in \#92;text{Student} \#92;vert  s \#92;text{ takes Seq. Alg.}\#92;}\#92;)  
\#92;(M=\#92;{s\#92;in \#92;text{Student} \#92;vert  s \#92;text{ takes Mult. Agent Systems}\#92;}\#92;)

* \#92;(\#92;vert \#92;text{Students}\#92;vert  =100\#92;)
* \#92;(\#92;vert S\#92;vert =40\#92;)
* \#92;(\#92;vert M\#92;vert  = 80\#92;)
* \#92;(\#92;vert S\#92;cap M\#92;vert  =25\#92;)

\#92;(40+80-25=95=\#92;vert S\#92;cup M\#92;vert \#92;)
\#92;(\#92;vert \#92;sim(S\#92;cup M)\#92;vert =100-95=5\#92;)

Therefore, 5 students took neither as they were part of the universal set but not part of the union of the two subsets.

## Computing the Cardinality of a Union of Three Sets
If \#92;(A\#92;), \#92;(B\#92;) and \#92;(C\#92;) are sets then:

\#92;[\#92;vert A\#92;cup B \#92;cup C\#92;vert = \#92;vert A\#92;vert  +\#92;vert B\#92;vert  + \#92;vert C\#92;vert  - \#92;vert A\#92;cap B\#92;vert -\#92;vert A\#92;cap C\#92;vert  - \#92;vert B\#92;cap C\#92;vert  + \#92;vert A\#92;cap B\#92;cap C\#92;vert \#92;]

This and the last union are special cases of the **principle of inclusion and exclusion**.

## Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion
Let \#92;(A_1,A_2,\#92;ldots,A_n\#92;) be sets.

Then:

\#92;[\#92;left\#92;vert A_1\#92;cup\#92;ldots\#92;cup A_n\#92;right\#92;vert =\#92;sum_{1\#92;leq k\#92;leq n} \#92;left\#92;vert A_i\#92;right\#92;vert -\#92;sum_{1\#92;leq j\#92;leq k\#92;leq n} \#92;left\#92;vert A_j \#92;cap A_k\#92;right\#92;vert +\#92;sum_{1\#92;leq i\#92;leq j\#92;leq k\#92;leq n} \#92;left\#92;vert A_i \#92;cap A_j \#92;cap A_k\#92;right\#92;vert \#92;]
\#92;[-...+(-1)^{n-1}\#92;left\#92;vert A_1\#92;cap\#92;ldots\#92;cap A_n\#92;right\#92;vert \#92;]
