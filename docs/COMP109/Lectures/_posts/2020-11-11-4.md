## Injective (one-to-one) Functions
Let \#92;(f:A\#92;rightarrow B\#92;) be a function. We call \#92;(f\#92;) and injective, or one-to-one, function if:

\#92;[f(a_1)=f(a_2)\#92;Rightarrow a_1 = a_2 \#92;text{ for all } a_1,a_2\#92;in A\#92;]

This is logically equivalent to \#92;(a_1\#92;neq a_2 \#92;Rightarrow f(a_1) \#92;neq f(a_2)\#92;) and so injective functions never repeat values. In other words:

Different inputs give different outputs.

### Example 1
\#92;(f:\#92;mathbb{Z}\#92;rightarrow \#92;mathbb{Z}\#92;) given by \#92;(f(x)=x^2\#92;) is not injective.

\#92;(h:\#92;mathbb{Z}\#92;rightarrow \#92;mathbb{Z}\#92;) given by \#92;(h(x)=2x\#92;) is injective.

### Example 2
To prove that a function is not injective you can give an individual example of a double mapping.

Take the following question foe the opposite:

\#92;(h:\#92;mathbb{Z}\#92;rightarrow \#92;mathbb{Z}\#92;) given by \#92;(h(x)=2x\#92;) is injective.

#### Proof
Suppose for a proof by contradiction that there exist \#92;(a_1,a_2\#92;) such that \#92;(h(a_1=h(a_2)\#92;) and \#92;(a_1\#92;neq a_2\#92;).

\#92;(2\#92;times a_1 = 2a_2 \#92;Rightarrow a_1 = a_2\#92;), a contradiction.

## Surjective (or onto) Functions
\#92;(f:A\#92;rightarrow B\#92;) is surjective, or onto, if the range of \#92;(f\#92;) coincides with the co-domain \#92;(f\#92;). This means that for every \#92;(b\#92;in B\#92;) there exists an \#92;(a\#92;in A\#92;) with \#92;(b=f(a)\#92;).

### Examples
\#92;(h:\#92;mathbb{Z}\#92;rightarrow \#92;mathbb{Z}\#92;) given by \#92;(h(x)=2x\#92;) is not surjective.

This is because you get every even values out as an answer.

\#92;(h':\#92;mathbb{Q}\#92;rightarrow \#92;mathbb{Q}\#92;) given by \#92;(h'(x)=2x\#92;) is surjective.

This is as you can use rational numbers to make any other number when doubled.

## Question
Classify \#92;(f:\#92;{a,b,c\#92;}\#92;rightarrow\#92;{1,2,3\#92;}\#92;) given by:

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph x
a
b
c
end
subgraph fx
1
2
3
end
a --> 1
b --> 1
c --> 3
2
```

* It is a function.
* Not injective, \#92;(f(a)=f(b)=1\#92;)
* Not subjective as no \#92;(x\#92;) maps with \#92;(f(x)=2\#92;).

## Bijections
We call \#92;(f\#92;) bijective if \#92;(f\#92;) is both injective and surjective.

### Examples
\#92;(f:\#92;mathbb{Q}\#92;rightarrow \#92;mathbb{Q}\#92;) given by \#92;(f(x)=2x\#92;) is bijective.

## Inverse Functions
If \#92;(f\#92;) is a bijection from a set \#92;(X\#92;) to a set \#92;(Y\#92;), then there is a function \#92;(f^{-1}\#92;) from \#92;(Y\#92;) to \#92;(X\#92;) that undoes the action of \#92;(f\#92;); that is, it sends each element of \#92;(Y\#92;) back to the element of \#92;(X\#92;) that it came from. This function is called the inverse function for \#92;(f\#92;).

Then \#92;(f(a)=b\#92;) if, and only if, \#92;(f^{-1}(b)=a\#92;)

### Example
\#92;(k:\#92;mathbb{R}\#92;rightarrow \#92;mathbb{R}\#92;) given by \#92;(k(x)=4x+3\#92;) is invertible and \#92;(k^{-1}(y)=\#92;frac{1}{4}(y-3)\#92;). 

\#92;(y=4x+3\#92;). So \#92;(4x+3=y\#92;), \#92;(4x=y-3\#92;), \#92;(x = \#92;frac{y-3}{4}\#92;)

This proves the statement by giving the same value.
