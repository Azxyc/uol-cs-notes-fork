## Uncountable Sets
A set that is not countable is called uncountable. The following set is uncountable:

&#92;[S = &#92;{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert 0 < x < 1 &#92;}&#92;]

There is no bijective function from this set to the set of all natural numbers.

### Cantor's Diagonal Argument
Suppose for a proof by contradiction that there exists a bijection &#92;(f:\mathbb{N^+}\rightarrow S&#92;). Consider decimal representation of &#92;(f(n)&#92;), for &#92;(n\in\mathbb{N^+}&#92;):

*In this example we are proving for all decimals between 0 and 1. We are considering that there is a mapping that makes them countable.*

* &#92;(f(1)=0.a_{11}a_{12}a_{13}\ldots a_{1n}\ldots&#92;)
* &#92;(f(2)=0.a_{21}a_{22}a_{23}\ldots a_{2n}\ldots&#92;)
* &#92;(f(3)=0.a_{31}a_{32}a_{33}\ldots a_{3n}\ldots&#92;)
* &#92;(\vdots&#92;)
* &#92;(f(n)=0.a_{n1}a_{n2}a_{n3}\ldots a_{nn}\ldots&#92;)
* &#92;(\vdots&#92;)

In this proof we treat this as a table without the leading zero and consider the main diagonal where the digit  &#92;(a_{ij}&#92;) has equal &#92;(i&#92;) and &#92;(j&#92;).

We show that there exists &#92;(d\in S&#92;) such that for no &#92;(i\in\mathbb{N^+}&#92;) we have &#92;(f(i)=d&#92;).

Let &#92;(d=0.d_{1}d_{2}d_{3}\ldots d_{n}\ldots&#92;) where &#92;(d_i=\begin{cases}2, & \text{if } a_{ii}=1&#92;&#92; 1, & \text{if } a_{ii}\neq 1\end{cases}&#92;)

Then for every &#92;(i\in\mathbb{N^+}&#92;) &#92;(d&#92;) is different at position &#92;(i&#92;) from &#92;(f(i)&#92;). So, for no &#92;(i\in\mathbb{N^+}&#92;) we have &#92;(f(i)=d&#92;), fo &#92;(f&#92;) is not surjective. A contradiction.
