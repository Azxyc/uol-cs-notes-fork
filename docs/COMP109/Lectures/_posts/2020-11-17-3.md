## Uncountable Sets
A set that is not countable is called uncountable. The following set is uncountable:

\#92;[S = \#92;{ x \#92;in \#92;mathbb{R} \#92;vert 0 < x < 1 \#92;}\#92;]

There is no bijective function from this set to the set of all natural numbers.

### Cantor's Diagonal Argument
Suppose for a proof by contradiction that there exists a bijection \#92;(f:\#92;mathbb{N^+}\#92;rightarrow S\#92;). Consider decimal representation of \#92;(f(n)\#92;), for \#92;(n\#92;in\#92;mathbb{N^+}\#92;):

*In this example we are proving for all decimals between 0 and 1. We are considering that there is a mapping that makes them countable.*

* \#92;(f(1)=0.a_{11}a_{12}a_{13}\#92;ldots a_{1n}\#92;ldots\#92;)
* \#92;(f(2)=0.a_{21}a_{22}a_{23}\#92;ldots a_{2n}\#92;ldots\#92;)
* \#92;(f(3)=0.a_{31}a_{32}a_{33}\#92;ldots a_{3n}\#92;ldots\#92;)
* \#92;(\#92;vdots\#92;)
* \#92;(f(n)=0.a_{n1}a_{n2}a_{n3}\#92;ldots a_{nn}\#92;ldots\#92;)
* \#92;(\#92;vdots\#92;)

In this proof we treat this as a table without the leading zero and consider the main diagonal where the digit  \#92;(a_{ij}\#92;) has equal \#92;(i\#92;) and \#92;(j\#92;).

We show that there exists \#92;(d\#92;in S\#92;) such that for no \#92;(i\#92;in\#92;mathbb{N^+}\#92;) we have \#92;(f(i)=d\#92;).

Let \#92;(d=0.d_{1}d_{2}d_{3}\#92;ldots d_{n}\#92;ldots\#92;) where \#92;(d_i=\#92;begin{cases}2, & \#92;text{if } a_{ii}=1\#92;\#92; 1, & \#92;text{if } a_{ii}\#92;neq 1\#92;end{cases}\#92;)

Then for every \#92;(i\#92;in\#92;mathbb{N^+}\#92;) \#92;(d\#92;) is different at position \#92;(i\#92;) from \#92;(f(i)\#92;). So, for no \#92;(i\#92;in\#92;mathbb{N^+}\#92;) we have \#92;(f(i)=d\#92;), fo \#92;(f\#92;) is not surjective. A contradiction.
