## Cartesian Product
For the Cartesian product you are making a list of all possibilities of the elements in both sets. This is similar to multiplying brackets.

### Example
Let {% raw %}\(A=\{1,2\}\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(B=\{a,b,c\}\){% endraw %}, then:

{% raw %}\[A\times B = \{(1,a),(2,a),(1,b),(2,b),(1,c),(2,c)\}\]{% endraw %}

Therefore:

{% raw %}\[B\times A = \{(a,1),(a,2),(b,1),(b,2),(c,1),(c,2)\}\]{% endraw %}

### Relations
Any relation between the elements in set {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} will be in the set of their Cartesian product.

A **binary relation** between two sets {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} is a subset {% raw %}\(R\){% endraw %} of the Cartesian product {% raw %}\(A\times B\){% endraw %}.

If {% raw %}\(A=B\){% endraw %}, then {% raw %}\(R\){% endraw %} is called **a binary relation on {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %}**.

### Family Tree Example
The set {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} is the set of all people in the tree.

jm[John and Mary] --- ks
jm --- Mike
jm --- Penny
```

1. {% raw %}\(R=\{(x,y)\vert x\text{ is a grandfather of } y\}\){% endraw %}

	For this set:

	{% raw %}\(R=\{\text{(Fred, Jane), (Fred, Fiona), (Fred, Alan), (John, Jayne), (John, Fiona), (John, Alan)}\}\){% endraw %}

2. {% raw %}\(S=\{(x,y)\vert x\text{ is a sister of } y\}\){% endraw %}

	For this set:

	{% raw %}\(S=\{\text{(Alice, Ken), (Sue, Mike), (Sue, Penny), (Penny, Sue), (Penny, Mike), (Jane, Fiona)}\}\){% endraw %}

### Algebraic Example
Write down the ordered parts belonging to the following binary relations between {% raw %}\(A=\{1,3,5,7\}\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(B=\{2,4,6\}:\){% endraw %}

1. {% raw %}\(U=\{(x,y)\in A\times B \vert x + y = 9\}\){% endraw %}

	This means the combinations from the two sets where the elements sum to 9.

	{% raw %}\(U=\{(3,6),(5,4),(7,2)\}\){% endraw %}

2. {% raw %}\(V=\{(x,y)\in A\times B \vert x < y \}\){% endraw %}

	This is the set of all pairs such that the first element is smaller than the second element.

	{% raw %}\(V=\{(1,2),(1,4),(1,6),(3,4),(3,6),(5,6)\}\){% endraw %}
