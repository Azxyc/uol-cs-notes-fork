## Digraph Representation of Relations

Recall that a function {% raw %}\(f\){% endraw %} from a set {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} to a set {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} assigns exactly one element of {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} to each element of {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %}.

* Gives rise to the relation {% raw %}\(R_f=\{(a,b)\in A\times B \vert b =f(a)\}\){% endraw %}

If a relation {% raw %}\(S\subseteq A\times B\){% endraw %} is such that for every {% raw %}\(a\in A\){% endraw %} there exists at most one {% raw %}\(b\in B\){% endraw %} with {% raw %}\((a,b)\in S\){% endraw %}, relation {% raw %}\(S\){% endraw %} is **functional**.

Sometimes in the literature, functions are introduces through functional relations.

### Example
{% raw %}\(A\{i\in \Bbb{N}\vert i<10\},B=\{i\in\Bbb{N}\vert 5<i<15\},R=\{((x,y)\in A\times B\vert y =2x)\}\){% endraw %}

```

As this is a relation there are allowed to be values in the set {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} which don't have a mapping to a value in the set {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %}. If this was a function and not a relation that wouldn't be allowed.

This is a functional relation as each item in  {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} only has **one** mapping to {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %}.
