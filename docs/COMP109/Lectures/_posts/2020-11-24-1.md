## Properties of Relations on a Set
### Infix Notation for Binary Relations
If \#92;(R\#92;) is a binary relation then we write \#92;(xRy\#92;) whenever \#92;((x,y)\#92;in R\#92;). The predicate \#92;(xRy\#92;) is read as \#92;(x\#92;) is \#92;(R\#92;)-related to \#92;(y\#92;).

This is similar to the notation \#92;(a\#92;subseteq b\#92;) or \#92;(a\#92;leq b\#92;). 

### Comparing Strings
Consider relations \#92;(R,S\#92;) and \#92;(L\#92;) on the set of all strings:

* \#92;(R\#92;)-lexicographic ordering.
	* This is alphabetic ordering.
* \#92;(uSv\#92;) if, and only if, \#92;(u\#92;) is a sub-string of \#92;(v\#92;).
	* \#92;(\#92;text{an}S\#92;text{ana},\#92; \#92;text{ana}S\#92;text{banana}\#92;).
	* \#92;(uSv,\#92; vSw\#92;Rightarrow uSw\#92;).\#92;
		* This means that for any ordering such as \#92;(u\#92;) then \#92;(v\#92;) the ordering of \#92;(u\#92;) and \#92;(w\#92;) is also true provided that we know that \#92;(v<w\#92;).
* \#92;(uLv\#92;) if, and only if, \#92;(\#92;text{len}(u)\#92;leq \#92;text{len}(v)\#92;).

For any of these relations:

\#92;[\#92;forall u,v \#92;text{ if } uRv \#92;text{ and } vRu\#92;Rightarrow u=v\#92;]

This means if the relation works both ways then they are equal in terms of the ordering.
