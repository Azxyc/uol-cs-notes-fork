## Properties of Relations on a Set
### Infix Notation for Binary Relations
If $$R$$ is a binary relation then we write $$xRy$$ whenever $$(x,y)\in R$$. The predicate $$xRy$$ is read as $$x$$ is $$R$$-related to $$y$$.

This is similar to the notation $$a\subseteq b$$ or $$a\leq b$$. 

### Comparing Strings
Consider relations $$R,S$$ and $$L$$ on the set of all strings:

* $$R$$-lexicographic ordering.
	* This is alphabetic ordering.
* $$uSv$$ if, and only if, $$u$$ is a sub-string of $$v$$.
	* $$\text{an}S\text{ana},\ \text{ana}S\text{banana}$$.
	* $$uSv,\ vSw\Rightarrow uSw$$.
		* This means that for any ordering such as $$u$$ then $$v$$ the ordering of $$u$$ and $$w$$ is also true provided that we know that $$v<w$$.
* $$uLv$$ if, and only if, $$\text{len}(u)\leq \text{len}(v)$$.

For any of these relations:

$$\forall u,v \text{ if } uRv \text{ and } vRu\Rightarrow u=v$$

This means if the relation works both ways then they are equal in terms of the ordering.
