## Properties of Relations on a Set
### Infix Notation for Binary Relations
If &#92;(R&#92;) is a binary relation then we write &#92;(xRy&#92;) whenever &#92;((x,y)\in R&#92;). The predicate &#92;(xRy&#92;) is read as &#92;(x&#92;) is &#92;(R&#92;)-related to &#92;(y&#92;).

This is similar to the notation &#92;(a\subseteq b&#92;) or &#92;(a\leq b&#92;). 

### Comparing Strings
Consider relations &#92;(R,S&#92;) and &#92;(L&#92;) on the set of all strings:

* &#92;(R&#92;)-lexicographic ordering.
	* This is alphabetic ordering.
* &#92;(uSv&#92;) if, and only if, &#92;(u&#92;) is a sub-string of &#92;(v&#92;).
	* &#92;(\text{an}S\text{ana},\ \text{ana}S\text{banana}&#92;).
	* &#92;(uSv,\ vSw\Rightarrow uSw&#92;).\
		* This means that for any ordering such as &#92;(u&#92;) then &#92;(v&#92;) the ordering of &#92;(u&#92;) and &#92;(w&#92;) is also true provided that we know that &#92;(v<w&#92;).
* &#92;(uLv&#92;) if, and only if, &#92;(\text{len}(u)\leq \text{len}(v)&#92;).

For any of these relations:

&#92;[\forall u,v \text{ if } uRv \text{ and } vRu\Rightarrow u=v&#92;]

This means if the relation works both ways then they are equal in terms of the ordering.
