## Properties of Binary Relations
A binary relation \$$R\$$ on a set \$$A\$$ is:

### Reflexive 
When \$$xRx\$$ for all \$$x\in A\$$.

$$\forall x\ A(x)\Rightarrow xRx$$

This means that if two of the same elements are compared successfully then the relation is reflexive.

As example of a relation that is non-reflexive is \$$<\$$ as the left must be different to the right.

### Symmetric
When \$$xRy\$$ implies \$$yRx\$$ for all \$$x,y\in A\$$:

$$\forall x,y\ xRy\Rightarrow yRx$$

This is similar to Facebook friends. If you are friends with one person they have to be your friend too.

An example that is non-symmetric is \$$\leq\$$ as they are not necessarily comparable.

### Antisymmetric
When \$$xRy\$$ and \$$yRx\$$ imply \$$x=y\$$ for all \$$x,y\in A\$$:

$$\forall x,y\ xRy\text{ and } yRx\Rightarrow y = x$$

This means that if you can swap the elements and the relation still holds true then the elements must be equal. This is the same as the \$$\leq\$$ relation.

The \$$L\$$ relation from before doesn't satisfy this property as two different words with the same length are not the same.

### Transitive
When \$$xRy\$$ and \$$yRz\$$ imply \$$xRz\$$ for all \$$x,y,z\in A\$$:

$$\forall x,y,z\ xRy\text{ and }yRz\Rightarrow xRz$$

This is the same as the ordering example from before. Thus the relationship \$$<\$$ satisfies this property.

## Examples
Which of the following define a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric of transitive?

1. \$$x\$$ divides \$$y\$$ on the set \$$\Bbb{Z^+}\$$ of positive integers.
	* This relations is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
1. \$$x\neq y\$$ on the set \$$\Bbb{Z}\$$ of integers.
	* This relations is symmetric and transitive.
1. \$$x\$$ has the same age as \$$y\$$ on the set of people.
	* This relations is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
