## Properties of Binary Relations
A binary relation \#92;(R\#92;) on a set \#92;(A\#92;) is:

### Reflexive 
When \#92;(xRx\#92;) for all \#92;(x\#92;in A\#92;).

\#92;[\#92;forall x\#92; A(x)\#92;Rightarrow xRx\#92;]

This means that if two of the same elements are compared successfully then the relation is reflexive.

As example of a relation that is non-reflexive is \#92;(<\#92;) as the left must be different to the right.

### Symmetric
When \#92;(xRy\#92;) implies \#92;(yRx\#92;) for all \#92;(x,y\#92;in A\#92;):

\#92;[\#92;forall x,y\#92; xRy\#92;Rightarrow yRx\#92;]

This is similar to Facebook friends. If you are friends with one person they have to be your friend too.

An example that is non-symmetric is \#92;(\#92;leq\#92;) as they are not necessarily comparable.

### Antisymmetric
When \#92;(xRy\#92;) and \#92;(yRx\#92;) imply \#92;(x=y\#92;) for all \#92;(x,y\#92;in A\#92;):

\#92;[\#92;forall x,y\#92; xRy\#92;text{ and } yRx\#92;Rightarrow y = x\#92;]

This means that if you can swap the elements and the relation still holds true then the elements must be equal. This is the same as the \#92;(\#92;leq\#92;) relation.

The \#92;(L\#92;) relation from before doesn't satisfy this property as two different words with the same length are not the same.

### Transitive
When \#92;(xRy\#92;) and \#92;(yRz\#92;) imply \#92;(xRz\#92;) for all \#92;(x,y,z\#92;in A\#92;):

\#92;[\#92;forall x,y,z\#92; xRy\#92;text{ and }yRz\#92;Rightarrow xRz\#92;]

This is the same as the ordering example from before. Thus the relationship \#92;(<\#92;) satisfies this property.

## Examples
Which of the following define a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric of transitive?

1. \#92;(x\#92;) divides \#92;(y\#92;) on the set \#92;(\#92;Bbb{Z^+}\#92;) of positive integers.
	* This relations is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
1. \#92;(x\#92;neq y\#92;) on the set \#92;(\#92;Bbb{Z}\#92;) of integers.
	* This relations is symmetric and transitive.
1. \#92;(x\#92;) has the same age as \#92;(y\#92;) on the set of people.
	* This relations is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
