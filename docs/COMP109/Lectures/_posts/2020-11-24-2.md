## Properties of Binary Relations
A binary relation {% raw %}\(R\){% endraw %} on a set {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} is:

### Reflexive 
When {% raw %}\(xRx\){% endraw %} for all {% raw %}\(x\in A\){% endraw %}.

{% raw %}\[\forall x\ A(x)\Rightarrow xRx\]{% endraw %}

This means that if two of the same elements are compared successfully then the relation is reflexive.

As example of a relation that is non-reflexive is {% raw %}\(<\){% endraw %} as the left must be different to the right.

### Symmetric
When {% raw %}\(xRy\){% endraw %} implies {% raw %}\(yRx\){% endraw %} for all {% raw %}\(x,y\in A\){% endraw %}:

{% raw %}\[\forall x,y\ xRy\Rightarrow yRx\]{% endraw %}

This is similar to Facebook friends. If you are friends with one person they have to be your friend too.

An example that is non-symmetric is {% raw %}\(\leq\){% endraw %} as they are not necessarily comparable.

### Antisymmetric
When {% raw %}\(xRy\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(yRx\){% endraw %} imply {% raw %}\(x=y\){% endraw %} for all {% raw %}\(x,y\in A\){% endraw %}:

{% raw %}\[\forall x,y\ xRy\text{ and } yRx\Rightarrow y = x\]{% endraw %}

This means that if you can swap the elements and the relation still holds true then the elements must be equal. This is the same as the {% raw %}\(\leq\){% endraw %} relation.

The {% raw %}\(L\){% endraw %} relation from before doesn't satisfy this property as two different words with the same length are not the same.

### Transitive
When {% raw %}\(xRy\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(yRz\){% endraw %} imply {% raw %}\(xRz\){% endraw %} for all {% raw %}\(x,y,z\in A\){% endraw %}:

{% raw %}\[\forall x,y,z\ xRy\text{ and }yRz\Rightarrow xRz\]{% endraw %}

This is the same as the ordering example from before. Thus the relationship {% raw %}\(<\){% endraw %} satisfies this property.

## Examples
Which of the following define a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric of transitive?

1. {% raw %}\(x\){% endraw %} divides {% raw %}\(y\){% endraw %} on the set {% raw %}\(\Bbb{Z^+}\){% endraw %} of positive integers.
	* This relations is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
1. {% raw %}\(x\neq y\){% endraw %} on the set {% raw %}\(\Bbb{Z}\){% endraw %} of integers.
	* This relations is symmetric and transitive.
1. {% raw %}\(x\){% endraw %} has the same age as {% raw %}\(y\){% endraw %} on the set of people.
	* This relations is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
