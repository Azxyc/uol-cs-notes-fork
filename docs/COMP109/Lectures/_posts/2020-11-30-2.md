## Truth Values
Interpretations are a way of assigning values to propositions which may vary depending on the situation or person who answers them.

An interpretation &#92;(I&#92;) is a function which assigns to any atomic proposition &#92;(p_i&#92;) a truth value:

&#92;[I(p_i)\in &#92;{0,1&#92;}&#92;]

* If &#92;(I(p_i)=1&#92;), then &#92;(p_i&#92;) is called **true** under the interpretation &#92;(I&#92;).
* If &#92;(I(p_i)=0&#92;), then &#92;(p_i&#92;) is called **false** under the interpretation &#92;(I&#92;).

Given an assignment &#92;(I&#92;) we can compute the truth value of compute formulas step by step using so-called truth tables.

### Implication

The implication &#92;((P\Rightarrow Q)&#92;) of &#92;(P&#92;)  and &#92;(Q&#92;):
 &#92;[\text{If } P \text{ then } Q&#92;]
 
#### Truth Table

| &#92;(P&#92;) | &#92;(Q&#92;) | &#92;((P\Rightarrow Q)&#92;) |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |  
| 0 | 0 | 1 |

Consider this table with the proposition &#92;(P&#92;) being a promise. If you don't make a promise but you fulfil it anyway then you aren't breaking that promise.

Another example would be the following statement:

* If a number is divisible by 6 then it is divisible by 3. 
    * If it is not divisible by 6 but still divides by 3, this does not invalidate the proposition.
