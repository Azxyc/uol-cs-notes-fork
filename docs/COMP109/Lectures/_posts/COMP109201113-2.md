# Functions - 4
## Extended Pigeonhole Principle
Consider a function $f:A\rightarrow B$ where $A$ and $B$ are finite sets and $|A|>k|B|$ for some natural number $k$. Then, there is a value of $f$ which occurs at least $k+1$ times.

```mermaid
graph TD
subgraph A
a
b
c
d
e
f
g
end 
subgraph B
1
2
3
end
a --> 1
b --> 2
c --> 3
d --> 1
e --> 2
f --> 3
g --> 1
```

In this graph $k=2$. Additionally you can see that the value 1 occurs $k+1=3$ times as $a,d$ and $g$ all map to it.

### Example
How many different surnames must appear in a telephone directory to guarantee that at least five of the surnames begin with the same letter of the alphabet and end with the same letter of the alphabet?

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph A
Names
end
subgraph B
a,a
...
end
Names --> a,a
Names --> ...
```

$|B|=26^2$

Therefore:

Due to the principles covered above, $|A|>4|B|$

Thus:

$|A|=4\times26\times26+1=2705$
