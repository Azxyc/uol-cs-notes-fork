For all algorithms there are certain properties that they can be evaluated against:

* Completeness
	* Does the algorithm always find a solution if one exists?
	
	This is true for BFS but not for DFS as cycles can stop depth first if there is a loop.
	
* Optimality
	* Does the algorithm always find a shortest path or one of lowest cost?
	
	Yes for BFS but no for DFS (neither take into account cost, just steps.)
	
* Time Complexity
	* What are the number of paths generated?/How long will it take to compute?
	
	Harder to answer. This will need to be computed
	
* Space Complexity
	* What are the maximum number of paths in memory (in frontier)?
	
	This will always be smaller or equal to the time complexity but it is still harder to answer.
	
## Time & Space Complexity

Time and space complexity are measured in terms of:

* &#92;(b&#92;) - Maximum branching factor
	* The maximal number of successor states of a state in the state space.
* &#92;(d&#92;) - Depth of the optimal solution
	* The length of the shortest path from the start state to a goal state.
* &#92;(m&#92;) - Maximum depth of the state space
	* the length of the longest path in the state space (may be &#92;(&#92;infty&#92;) to to loops)
	
### Example 1 - 8 Puzzle

* &#92;(b&#92;) (maximum branching factor) is 4
* &#92;(d&#92;) (optimal solution) is 31
* &#92;(m&#92;) (longest path) is &#92;(&#92;infty&#92;) as there are cycles

### Example 2 - Holiday in Romania

* &#92;(b=4&#92;)
* &#92;(d=3&#92;)
* &#92;(m=&#92;infty&#92;)

## Properties of Breadth First Search

The number of paths of length &#92;(d&#92;) in a search tree with maximum branching factor &#92;(b&#92;) is at most &#92;(b^d&#92;).

The number of paths of length at most &#92;(d&#92;) in a search tree with maximum branching factor &#92;(b&#92;) is at most &#92;(1+b+b^2+&#92;ldots + b^d&#92;).
{:.info}

* Time complexity
	* If the shortest path to a goal state has length &#92;(d&#92;) then the worst case BFS will look at: &#92;[1+b+B^2+&#92;ldots +b^d&#92;] paths before reaching a goal state.

* Space complexity
	* If the shortest path to a goal state has length &#92;(d&#92;), then in the worst case the frontier can contain &#92;(b^d&#92;) paths and so the memory requirement is &#92;(b^d&#92;).

### Complexity

| Depth | Paths | Time | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | 1 msec |
| 1 | 11 | .01 sec | 
| 2 | 111 | .1 sec | 
| 4 | 11,111 | 11 sec |
| 6 | 10^6 | 18 sec |
| 8 | 10^8 | 31 hours |
| 10 | 10^10 | 128 days |
| 12 |10^12 | 35 years |

## Properties of Depth First Search

* Not complete - No guarenteed to find a solution
* Not optimal - Solution is not guaranteed to be the shortest path.
* Time Complexity 
	* If the length of the longest path from the start state is &#92;(m&#92;), then the worst case DFS will look at: &#92;[1+b+b^2+&#92;ldots +b^m&#92;] This may be an issue as &#92;(m&#92;) is infinite in many problems.
* Space Complexity
	* If the length of the longest path starting at a goal state is &#92;(m&#92;), then the worst case the frontier can contain: &#92;[b&#92;times m&#92;] paths. if &#92;(m&#92;) is infinite, then the space requirement is infinite in the worst case. But if DFS finds a path to the goal state, then memory requirement is much less than for BFS.


## Summary

* DFS is complete ut expensive
* DFS is cheap in space complexity but incomplete
