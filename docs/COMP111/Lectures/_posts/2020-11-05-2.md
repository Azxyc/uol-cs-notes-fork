## Syntax
An **individual name** denote an individual object. They are also called **constant symbols**:

* England
* We also use lower case letters: \#92;(a,b,c,a_1,a_2,\#92;ldots\#92;)

An **individual variable** is a placeholder for an individual name. They are denoted by lower case letters:

* \#92;(x,y,z,x_1,x_2,\#92;ldots\#92;)

A **class name** denotes a set of individual objects. They are often also called **unary predicate symbols**:

* Human_Being
* We also often use upper case letters such as \#92;(A,B,C,A_1,A_2\#92;)

### Atomic Assertions

An atomic assertion takes the form \#92;(A(b)\#92;) and state the \#92;(b\#92;) is in the class \#92;(A\#92;):

* The assertion,
\#92;[\#92;text{CompetesInPremierLeague}(\#92;text{LiverpoolFC})\#92;] states that Liverpool FC competes in the Premier League.

### Unary Rule
A unary rule take the form:
\#92;[A_1(x)\#92;wedge\#92;ldots\#92;wedge A_n(x)\#92;rightarrow A(x)\#92;]
Where \#92;(A_1,ldots,A_n\#92;) and \#92;(A\#92;) are class names and \#92;(x\#92;) is an individual variable.

* The \#92;(\#92;wedge\#92;) symbol is the symbol for logical AND.
* The \#92;(\#92;rightarrow\#92;) symbol means **implies that**.

The rule states the everything in all classes \#92;(A_1,A_2,\#92;ldots,A_n\#92;) is in the class A.

#### Example

The rule:
\#92;[\#92;text{Disease}(x)\#92;wedge\#92;text{LocatedInHeart}(x)\#92;rightarrow\#92;text{HeartDisease}(x)\#92;]
states that every disease located in the heart is a heart disease.

You can also say that the result of the evaluation on the left side is a subset of the objects in the set on the right hand side.

#### Unary Rule-Based Systems
A unary rule-based knowledge base \#92;(K\#92;) is a collection \#92;(K_a\#92;) of **atomic assertions** and \#92;(K_r\#92;) of **unary rules**.

##### Example
Let \#92;(K_a\#92;) contain the following atomic assertions:

* \#92;(\#92;text{CompetesInPremierLeague}(\#92;text{LiverpoolFC})\#92;)
* \#92;(\#92;text{CompetesInPremierLeague}(\#92;text{Everton})\#92;) and so on for all members of the class \#92;(\#92;text{CompetesInPremierLeague}\#92;)

Let \#92;(K_r\#92;) contain the following rules:

* \#92;(\#92;text{CompetesInPremierLeague}(x)\#92;rightarrow\#92;text{CompetesInFACup}(x)\#92;)
* \#92;(\#92;text{CompetesInPremierLeague}(x)\#92;rightarrow\#92;text{FootballClub}(x)\#92;)
* \#92;(\#92;text{CompetesInPremierLeague}(x)\#92;rightarrow\#92;text{BasedInEngland}(x)\#92;)

The follwoing atomic asseritons follow from \#92;(K\#92;):

* \#92;(\#92;text{CompetesInFACup}(\#92;text{LiverpoolFC})\#92;)
* \#92;(\#92;text{FootBallClub}(\#92;text{Everton})\#92;), and so on.

Thus from 20 facts and 3 rules, we can deduce 60 additional facts. This allows us to store much more data in a compact way.

## Reasoning in Rule-Based Systems
Let \#92;(K\#92;) be a knowledge base and \#92;(A(b)\#92;) an atomic assertion. Then \#92;(A(b)\#92;) **follows from** \#92;(K\#92;):
\#92;[K\#92;models A(b)\#92;]

You can also say that \#92;(K\#92;) **models** \#92;(A(b)\#92;).

This means that whenever \#92;(K\#92;) is true, then \#92;(A(b)\#92;) is true. If that is not the case you can write \#92;(K\#92;nvDash A(b)\#92;).

### Example 1
In the example \#92;(K\#92;) earlier:
\#92;[K\#92;models\#92;text{CompetesInFACup}(\#92;text{LiverpoolFC})\#92;]

### Example 2
Let:

* \#92;(K_a=\#92;{A_1(a)\#92;}\#92;)
* \#92;(K_r=\#92;{A_1(a)\#92;rightarrow A_2(x),A_2(x)\#92;rightarrow A_3(x)\#92;}\#92;)

Let \#92;(K\#92;) contain \#92;(K_a\#92;) and \#92;(K_r\#92;). Then:

* \#92;(K\#92;models A_1(a)\#92;)
* \#92;(K\#92;models A_2(a)\#92;)
* \#92;(K\#92;models A_3(a)\#92;)

This chaining shows that if \#92;(a\#92;) is in \#92;(A_1\#92;) then is also in \#92;(A_2\#92;) and so on.
