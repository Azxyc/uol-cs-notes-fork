## Syntax
An **individual name** denote an individual object. They are also called **constant symbols**:

* England
* We also use lower case letters: &#92;(a,b,c,a&#95;1,a&#95;2,\ldots&#92;)

An **individual variable** is a placeholder for an individual name. They are denoted by lower case letters:

* &#92;(x,y,z,x&#95;1,x&#95;2,\ldots&#92;)

A **class name** denotes a set of individual objects. They are often also called **unary predicate symbols**:

* Human&#95;Being
* We also often use upper case letters such as &#92;(A,B,C,A&#95;1,A&#95;2&#92;)

### Atomic Assertions

An atomic assertion takes the form &#92;(A(b)&#92;) and state the &#92;(b&#92;) is in the class &#92;(A&#92;):

* The assertion,
&#92;[\text{CompetesInPremierLeague}(\text{LiverpoolFC})&#92;] states that Liverpool FC competes in the Premier League.

### Unary Rule
A unary rule take the form:
&#92;[A&#95;1(x)\wedge\ldots\wedge A&#95;n(x)\rightarrow A(x)&#92;]
Where &#92;(A&#95;1,ldots,A&#95;n&#92;) and &#92;(A&#92;) are class names and &#92;(x&#92;) is an individual variable.

* The &#92;(\wedge&#92;) symbol is the symbol for logical AND.
* The &#92;(\rightarrow&#92;) symbol means **implies that**.

The rule states the everything in all classes &#92;(A&#95;1,A&#95;2,\ldots,A&#95;n&#92;) is in the class A.

#### Example

The rule:
&#92;[\text{Disease}(x)\wedge\text{LocatedInHeart}(x)\rightarrow\text{HeartDisease}(x)&#92;]
states that every disease located in the heart is a heart disease.

You can also say that the result of the evaluation on the left side is a subset of the objects in the set on the right hand side.

#### Unary Rule-Based Systems
A unary rule-based knowledge base &#92;(K&#92;) is a collection &#92;(K&#95;a&#92;) of **atomic assertions** and &#92;(K&#95;r&#92;) of **unary rules**.

##### Example
Let &#92;(K&#95;a&#92;) contain the following atomic assertions:

* &#92;(\text{CompetesInPremierLeague}(\text{LiverpoolFC})&#92;)
* &#92;(\text{CompetesInPremierLeague}(\text{Everton})&#92;) and so on for all members of the class &#92;(\text{CompetesInPremierLeague}&#92;)

Let &#92;(K&#95;r&#92;) contain the following rules:

* &#92;(\text{CompetesInPremierLeague}(x)\rightarrow\text{CompetesInFACup}(x)&#92;)
* &#92;(\text{CompetesInPremierLeague}(x)\rightarrow\text{FootballClub}(x)&#92;)
* &#92;(\text{CompetesInPremierLeague}(x)\rightarrow\text{BasedInEngland}(x)&#92;)

The follwoing atomic asseritons follow from &#92;(K&#92;):

* &#92;(\text{CompetesInFACup}(\text{LiverpoolFC})&#92;)
* &#92;(\text{FootBallClub}(\text{Everton})&#92;), and so on.

Thus from 20 facts and 3 rules, we can deduce 60 additional facts. This allows us to store much more data in a compact way.

## Reasoning in Rule-Based Systems
Let &#92;(K&#92;) be a knowledge base and &#92;(A(b)&#92;) an atomic assertion. Then &#92;(A(b)&#92;) **follows from** &#92;(K&#92;):
&#92;[K\models A(b)&#92;]

You can also say that &#92;(K&#92;) **models** &#92;(A(b)&#92;).

This means that whenever &#92;(K&#92;) is true, then &#92;(A(b)&#92;) is true. If that is not the case you can write &#92;(K\nvDash A(b)&#92;).

### Example 1
In the example &#92;(K&#92;) earlier:
&#92;[K\models\text{CompetesInFACup}(\text{LiverpoolFC})&#92;]

### Example 2
Let:

* &#92;(K&#95;a=&#92;{A&#95;1(a)&#92;}&#92;)
* &#92;(K&#95;r=&#92;{A&#95;1(a)\rightarrow A&#95;2(x),A&#95;2(x)\rightarrow A&#95;3(x)&#92;}&#92;)

Let &#92;(K&#92;) contain &#92;(K&#95;a&#92;) and &#92;(K&#95;r&#92;). Then:

* &#92;(K\models A&#95;1(a)&#92;)
* &#92;(K\models A&#95;2(a)&#92;)
* &#92;(K\models A&#95;3(a)&#92;)

This chaining shows that if &#92;(a&#92;) is in &#92;(A&#95;1&#92;) then is also in &#92;(A&#95;2&#92;) and so on.
