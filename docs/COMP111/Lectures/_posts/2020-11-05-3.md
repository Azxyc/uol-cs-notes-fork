title: COMP111 - Derived Assertions Algorithm
tags: COMP111 Lectures
---
The following algorithm take as input the knowledge base &#92;(K&#92;) containing &#92;(K&#95;a&#92;) and &#92;(K&#95;r&#92;) and computes all assertions &#92;(E(a)&#92;) with &#92;(E&#92;) a class name and &#92;(a&#92;) an individual name such that &#92;(K\models E(a)&#92;). This set is stored in: &#92;[\text{DerivedAssertions}&#92;] In only remains to check whether &#92;(A(b)&#92;) is in &#92;(\text{DerivedAssertions}&#92;). 

The algorithm computes the set &#92;(\text{DerivedAssertions}&#92;) by starting with &#92;(K&#95;a&#92;) and then applying the rules &#92;(K&#95;r&#92;) exhaustively to already derived atomic assertions.

```
Input: a knowledge base K containing assertions K&#95;a and rules K&#95;r
	
DerivedAssertions := K&#95;a
repeat
	if there exits E(a) not in DerivedAssertions
		and A&#95;1(x)^...^A&#95;n(x) --> E(x) in K&#95;r
		and A&#95;1(x),...,A&#95;n(x) in DerivedAssertions
	then 
		add E(a) to DerivedAssertions
		NewAssertion := true
	else 
		NewAssertion := false
	endif
until NewAssertion = false
return Derived Assertions
```

## Rule Application
In the algorithm above we say that:

&#92;(E(a)&#92;) is added to &#92;(\text{DerivedAssertions}&#92;) by applying the rule:
&#92;[A&#95;1(x)\wedge\ldots\wedge A&#95;n\rightarrow E(x)&#92;]
to the atomic assertions:
&#92;[A&#95;1(x),\ldots,A&#95;n\in\text{DerivedAssertions}&#92;]

### Example
Let:

* &#92;(K&#95;a=&#92;{A&#95;1(a)&#92;}&#92;)
* &#92;(K&#95;a=&#92;{A&#95;1(x)\rightarrow A&#95;2(x),A&#95;2(x)\rightarrow A&#95;3(x)&#92;}&#92;)

In:

* First &#92;(\text{DerivedAssertions}&#92;) contains &#92;(K&#95;a&#92;) only.

* Then an application of &#92;(A&#95;1(x)\rightarrow A&#95;2(x)&#92;) to &#92;(A&#95;1(a)&#92;) adds &#92;(A&#95;2(a)&#92;) to &#92;(\text{DerivedAssertions}&#92;).

* Then an application of &#92;(A&#95;2(x)\rightarrow A&#95;3(x)&#92;) to &#92;(A&#95;2(a)&#92;) adds &#92;(A&#95;3(a)&#92;) to &#92;(\text{DerivedAssertions}&#92;).

* Now no rule is applicable. Thus:
&#92;[\text{DerivedAssertions}=&#92;{A&#95;1(a),A&#95;2(a),A&#95;3(a)&#92;}&#92;]
is returned.
