A propositional formula is satisfiable if there exist an interpretation under which it is true.

### Example 1
The formula \#92;((p\#92;wedge\#92;neg p)\#92;) is not satisfiable, because:

\#92;[I(p\#92;wedge\#92;neg p)=0\#92;]

for all interpretations \#92;(I\#92;):

| \#92;(p\#92;) | \#92;(\#92;neg p\#92;) | \#92;((p\#92;wedge\#92;neg p)\#92;) |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |

As you can see from the table there is no case in which the case is satisfiable. 

### Example 2
There are some cases which don't require the truth table to be parsed in order to find out if it is satisfiable. See this question:

Is the formula, \#92;(P=(p_1\#92;Rightarrow(p_2\#92;wedge\#92;neg p_2))\#92;) satisfiable.

To see this, simply choose any interpretation \#92;(I\#92;) with \#92;(I(p_1)=0\#92;). Then \#92;(I(P)=1\#92;) and we have found an interpretation \#92;(I\#92;) that makes \#92;(P\#92;) true.

The same argument shows that every formula of the form \#92;((p_1\#92;Rightarrow Q)\#92;) is satisfiable.

There are also other combinations where you can prove that they are satisfiable without working any values. E.g.:

\#92;[(p_1\#92;Leftrightarrow Q)\#92;]

such that \#92;(p_1\#92;) does not occur in \#92;(Q\#92;) is satisfiable.

## Deciding Satisfiability 
* \#92;(P\#92;) is satisfiable if \#92;(I(P)=1\#92;) for some interpretation \#92;(I\#92;).
* There are \#92;(2^n\#92;) interpretations if \#92;(P\#92;) has \#92;(n\#92;) propositional atoms.
* Thus, to check whether \#92;(P\#92;) is satisfiable directly using truth tables, a table with \#92;(2^n\#92;) rows is needed.
* This is not practical, even for small \#92;(n\#92;)
	* Another case of combinatorial explosion.

There has been great progress in developing very fast satisfiability algorithms (called **SAT solvers**) that can deal with formulas with bery large numbers of propositional atoms (using heuristics).
