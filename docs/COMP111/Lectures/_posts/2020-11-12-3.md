A propositional formula is satisfiable if there exist an interpretation under which it is true.

### Example 1
The formula  \\((p \\wedge \\neg p) \\) is not satisfiable, because:

 \\[I(p \\wedge \\neg p)=0 \\]

for all interpretations  \\(I \\):

|  \\(p \\) |  \\( \\neg p \\) |  \\((p \\wedge \\neg p) \\) |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |

As you can see from the table there is no case in which the case is satisfiable. 

### Example 2
There are some cases which don't require the truth table to be parsed in order to find out if it is satisfiable. See this question:

Is the formula,  \\(P=(p_1 \\Rightarrow(p_2 \\wedge \\neg p_2)) \\) satisfiable.

To see this, simply choose any interpretation  \\(I \\) with  \\(I(p_1)=0 \\). Then  \\(I(P)=1 \\) and we have found an interpretation  \\(I \\) that makes  \\(P \\) true.

The same argument shows that every formula of the form  \\((p_1 \\Rightarrow Q) \\) is satisfiable.

There are also other combinations where you can prove that they are satisfiable without working any values. E.g.:

 \\[(p_1 \\Leftrightarrow Q) \\]

such that  \\(p_1 \\) does not occur in  \\(Q \\) is satisfiable.

## Deciding Satisfiability 
*  \\(P \\) is satisfiable if  \\(I(P)=1 \\) for some interpretation  \\(I \\).
* There are  \\(2^n \\) interpretations if  \\(P \\) has  \\(n \\) propositional atoms.
* Thus, to check whether  \\(P \\) is satisfiable directly using truth tables, a table with  \\(2^n \\) rows is needed.
* This is not practical, even for small  \\(n \\)
	* Another case of combinatorial explosion.

There has been great progress in developing very fast satisfiability algorithms (called **SAT solvers**) that can deal with formulas with bery large numbers of propositional atoms (using heuristics).
