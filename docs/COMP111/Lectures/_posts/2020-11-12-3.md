A propositional formula is satisfiable if there exist an interpretation under which it is true.

### Example 1
The formula `{% raw %}\((p\wedge\neg p)\){% endraw %}` is not satisfiable, because:

`{% raw %}\[I(p\wedge\neg p)=0\]{% endraw %}`

for all interpretations `{% raw %}\(I\){% endraw %}`:

| `{% raw %}\(p\){% endraw %}` | `{% raw %}\(\neg p\){% endraw %}` | `{% raw %}\((p\wedge\neg p)\){% endraw %}` |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |

As you can see from the table there is no case in which the case is satisfiable. 

### Example 2
There are some cases which don't require the truth table to be parsed in order to find out if it is satisfiable. See this question:

Is the formula, `{% raw %}\(P=(p_1\Rightarrow(p_2\wedge\neg p_2))\){% endraw %}` satisfiable.

To see this, simply choose any interpretation `{% raw %}\(I\){% endraw %}` with `{% raw %}\(I(p_1)=0\){% endraw %}`. Then `{% raw %}\(I(P)=1\){% endraw %}` and we have found an interpretation `{% raw %}\(I\){% endraw %}` that makes `{% raw %}\(P\){% endraw %}` true.

The same argument shows that every formula of the form `{% raw %}\((p_1\Rightarrow Q)\){% endraw %}` is satisfiable.

There are also other combinations where you can prove that they are satisfiable without working any values. E.g.:

`{% raw %}\[(p_1\Leftrightarrow Q)\]{% endraw %}`

such that `{% raw %}\(p_1\){% endraw %}` does not occur in `{% raw %}\(Q\){% endraw %}` is satisfiable.

## Deciding Satisfiability 
* `{% raw %}\(P\){% endraw %}` is satisfiable if `{% raw %}\(I(P)=1\){% endraw %}` for some interpretation `{% raw %}\(I\){% endraw %}`.
* There are `{% raw %}\(2^n\){% endraw %}` interpretations if `{% raw %}\(P\){% endraw %}` has `{% raw %}\(n\){% endraw %}` propositional atoms.
* Thus, to check whether `{% raw %}\(P\){% endraw %}` is satisfiable directly using truth tables, a table with `{% raw %}\(2^n\){% endraw %}` rows is needed.
* This is not practical, even for small `{% raw %}\(n\){% endraw %}`
	* Another case of combinatorial explosion.

There has been great progress in developing very fast satisfiability algorithms (called **SAT solvers**) that can deal with formulas with bery large numbers of propositional atoms (using heuristics).
