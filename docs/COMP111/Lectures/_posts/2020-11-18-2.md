An event is a subset \#92;(E ⊆ S\#92;) of the sample space \#92;(S\#92;). The probability of the even \#92;(E\#92;) is given by:

\#92;[P(E)=\#92;sum_{x\#92;in E}P(x)\#92;]

* \#92;(0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1\#92;) for every event \#92;(E\#92;)
* \#92;(P(\#92;emptyset) = 0\#92;) and \#92;(P(S) = 1\#92;)

## Example - Fair Dice
If I roll a die three times, the event \#92;(E\#92;) of rolling at least one 6 is given by:

* The set of sequences of length 4 over \#92;(\#92;{1,\#92;ldots,6\#92;}\#92;) containing at least one 6.
* \#92;(P(E)\#92;) is the number of sequences containing at least one 6 divided by \#92;(6\#92;times6\#92;times6\#92;times6=216\#92;).

If we roll a fair die, then the event E of rolling an odd number is given by:

* The set \#92;(E=\#92;{1,3,5\#92;}\#92;)
* \#92;(P(E)=P(1)+P(3)+P(5)=\#92;frac{1}{6}+\#92;frac{1}{6}+\#92;frac{1}{6}=\#92;frac{1}{2}\#92;)

## Probability of Composed Events
* The complement of an event can be computed from the probability of the event.
* The union of events can be computed from the probabilities of the individual events.

### Complement
Let \#92;(\#92;neg E = S - E\#92;). Then \#92;(P(\#92;neg E)=1-P(E)\#92;)

Additionally, \#92;(S=\#92;neg E\#92;cup E\#92;).

#### Proof

\#92;[1=\#92;sum_{x\#92;in S}P(x)=\#92;sum_{x\#92;in E}P(x)+\#92;sum_{x\#92;in \#92;neg E}P(x)\#92;]

Thus,

\#92;[\#92;sum_{x\#92;in\#92;neg E}P(x)=1-\#92;sum_{x\#92;in E}P(x)\#92;]

#### Example
What is the probability that at least one bit in a randomly generated sequence of 10 bits is 0?

* \#92;(S = \#92;{0, 1\#92;}^{10} =\#92;) all sequences of 0 and 1 of length 10.
* For every \#92;(x ∈ S, P(x) = (\#92;frac{1}{2})^{10} = \#92;frac{1}{2^{10}}\#92;).
* \#92;(E =\#92;) all sequences of 0 and 1 of length 10 containing at least one 0.
* \#92;(\#92;neg E=\#92;{1111111111\#92;}\#92;)
* \#92;(P(\#92;neg E)=\#92;frac{1}{2^{10}}\#92;)
* \#92;(P(E)=1-\#92;frac{1}{2^{10}}\#92;)

### Union
\#92;[P(E_1\#92;cup U_2)=P(E_1)+P(E_2)-P(E_1\#92;cap E_2)\#92;]

Additionally, \#92;(\#92;vert E_1\#92;cup E_2\#92;vert  = \#92;vert E_1\#92;vert +\#92;vert E_2\#92;vert -\#92;vert E_1\#92;cap E_2\#92;vert \#92;)

#### Proof

* \#92;(P(E_1)=\#92;sum_{x\#92;in E_1}P(x)\#92;)
* \#92;(P(E_2)=\#92;sum_{x\#92;in E_2}P(x)\#92;)
* \#92;(P(E_1\#92;cup E_2)=\#92;sum_{x\#92;in E_1\#92;cup E_2}P(x)\#92;)

Thus,

\#92;[
\#92;begin{aligned}
P(E_1\#92;cup E_2)&=\#92;sum_{x\#92;in E_1\#92;cup E_2}P(x)\#92;\#92;
&=\#92;sum_{x\#92;in E_1}P(x)+\#92;sum_{x\#92;in E_3}P(x)-\#92;sum_{x\#92;in E_1\#92;cup E_2}P(x)\#92;\#92;
&=P(E_1)+P(E_2)-P(E_1\#92;cap E_2)
\#92;end{aligned}
\#92;]

#### Example
Suppose I have a jar of 30 sweets:

\#92;vert  \#92;vert  Red \#92;vert  Blue \#92;vert  Green \#92;vert 
\#92;vert  :-: \#92;vert  :-: \#92;vert  :-: \#92;vert  :-: \#92;vert 
\#92;vert  Circular \#92;vert  2 \#92;vert  4 \#92;vert  3 \#92;vert 
\#92;vert  Square \#92;vert  6 \#92;vert  7 \#92;vert  8 \#92;vert 

The sample space \#92;(S\#92;) has 30 elements and if one chooses a sweet uniformly at random then then the probability for all \#92;(x\#92;in S\#92;) is:

\#92;[P(x)=\#92;frac{1}{30}\#92;]

What is the probability of choosing a red or circular sweet?

* The probability that it is red is \#92;(\#92;frac{2+6}{30}=\#92;frac{8}{30}(P(R)=\#92;frac{8}{30})\#92;)
* The probability that it is cicular is \#92;(\#92;frac{2+4+3}{30}=\#92;frac{9}{30}(P(C)=\#92;frac{9}{30})\#92;)

Then \#92;(P(R\#92;cup C)\#92;) is the probability that the sweet is red or circular:

\#92;[P(R\#92;cup C) = P(R)+P(C)-P(R\#92;cap C) = \#92;frac{8}{30}+\#92;frac{9}{30}-\#92;frac{2}{30}=\#92;frac{15}{30}=\#92;frac{1}{2}\#92;]
