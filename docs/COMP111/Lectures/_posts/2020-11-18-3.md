## Disjoint Events
Assume that &#92;(E _1,&#92;ldots,E_n&#92;) are mutually disjoint events. So &#92;(E_i&#92;cap E_j=&#92;emptyset&#92;) whenever &#92;(i&#92;neq j&#92;).

Then,

&#92;[P(&#92;bigcup_{i&#92;leq i &#92;leq n}E_i)=&#92;sum_{1&#92;leq i&#92;leq n}P(E_i)&#92;]

### Example - Three Dice
Suppose that I roll a fair die three times:

* &#92;(S&#92;) is the set of dequences of lengh three over &#92;(&#92;{1,&#92;ldots,6&#92;}&#92;) (or &#92;(&#92;{1,&#92;ldots,6&#92;}^3&#92;)).
* &#92;(P(x)=&#92;frac{1}{6&#92;times6&#92;times6}=&#92;frac{1}{216}&#92;) for all &#92;(x&#92;in S&#92;). 

What is the probability that I roll at least one 6?

Let &#92;(E_1&#92;): even that 1^st roll is a 6, &#92;(E_2&#92;): event that 2^nd roll is a 6; &#92;(E_3&#92;): event that 3^rd roll is a 6.

This means that we would like to know:

&#92;[P(E_1&#92;cup E_2 &#92;cup E_3)&#92;]

#### Computing the Probability of a Union of Three Sets

&#92;[
&#92;begin{aligned}
P(A&#92;cup B &#92;cup C)=&P(A)+P(B)+P(C)&#92;&#92;
&-P(A&#92;cap B)-P(A&#92;cap C)- P(B&#92;cap C)&#92;&#92;
&+P(A&#92;cap B &#92;cap C)&#92;&#92;
&#92;end{aligned}
&#92;]

Additionally:

&#92;[
&#92;begin{aligned}
&#92;vert A&#92;cup B &#92;cup C&#92;vert  =& &#92;vert A&#92;vert  + &#92;vert B&#92;vert +&#92;vert C&#92;vert&#92;&#92;
&-&#92;vert A&#92;cap B&#92;vert -&#92;vert A&#92;cap C&#92;vert -&#92;vert B&#92;cap C&#92;vert&#92;&#92;
&+&#92;vert A&#92;cap B &#92;cap C&#92;vert
&#92;end{aligned}
&#92;]

### Example Continued

* &#92;(E_1&#92;): even that 1^st roll is a 6.
* &#92;(E_2&#92;): event that 2^nd roll is a 6.
* &#92;(E_3&#92;): event that 3^rd roll is a 6.

We can calculate the answer with the equation from earlier:

&#92;[
&#92;begin{aligned}
P(E_1&#92;cup E_2 &#92;cup E_3)=&P(E_1)+P(E_2)+P(E_3)&#92;&#92;
&-P(E_1&#92;cap E_2)-P(E_1&#92;cap E_3)- P(E_2&#92;cap E_3)&#92;&#92;
&+P(E_1&#92;cap E_2 &#92;cap E_3)&#92;&#92;
=&&#92;frac{36}{216}+&#92;frac{36}{216}+&#92;frac{36}{216}&#92;&#92;
&-&#92;frac{6}{216}-&#92;frac{6}{216}-&#92;frac{6}{216}&#92;&#92;
&+&#92;frac{1}{216}&#92;&#92;
=&&#92;frac{91}{216}&#92;approx0.42
&#92;end{aligned}
&#92;]
