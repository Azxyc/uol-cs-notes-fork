In everyday language we refer to events that have nothing to do with each other as being independent.

## Definition
Events {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(A\)]]>{% endraw %} and {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(B\)]]>{% endraw %} are independent if:

{% raw %}<![CDATA[\[P(A\cap B)=P(A)\times P(B)\]]]>{% endraw %}

If {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(P(A)\neq 0\)]]>{% endraw %} and {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(P(B)\neq 0\)]]>{% endraw %}, then the following are equivalent:

* {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(A\)]]>{% endraw %} and {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(B\)]]>{% endraw %} are independent.
* {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(P(B)=P(B\vert A)\)]]>{% endraw %}
* {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(P(A)=P(A\vert B)\)]]>{% endraw %}

See [slides 31]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP111/Lectures/2020-11-19.pdf) for additional examples. This covers proving independence using the definition above.

## Independence for More Than Two Events
For a finite set of events there are two different types of independence:

### Pairwise Independence
{% raw %}<![CDATA[\(A_1,\ldots,A_n\)]]>{% endraw %} are pairwise independent if every pair of events is independent: for all distinct {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(k,m\)]]>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<![CDATA[\[P(A_m\cap A_k)=P(A_m)P(A_k)\]]]>{% endraw %}

### Mutual Independence
{% raw %}<![CDATA[\(A_1,\ldots,A_n\)]]>{% endraw %} are mutually independent if every event is independent of any intersection of the events: for all distinct {% raw %}<![CDATA[\(k,m\)]]>{% endraw %}
 
{% raw %}<![CDATA[\[P(A_{k1})\times\ldots\times P(A_{k_m})=P(A_{k_1}\cap\ldots\cap A_{k_m})\]]]>{% endraw %}

Pairwise independence doesn't imply pairwise independence. Generally, if it isn't stated, then we are talking about **mutual independence**.

To see the proof and example of why pairwise independence does not imply mutual independence see [slide 37 onward]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP111/Lectures/2020-11-19.pdf). This example also shows examples of probability set notation.
