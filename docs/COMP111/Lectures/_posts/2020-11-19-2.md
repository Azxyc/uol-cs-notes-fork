In everyday language we refer to events that have nothing to do with each other as being independent.

## Definition
Events &#92;(A&#92;) and &#92;(B&#92;) are independent if:

&#92;[P(A&#92;cap B)=P(A)&#92;times P(B)&#92;]

If &#92;(P(A)&#92;neq 0&#92;) and &#92;(P(B)&#92;neq 0&#92;), then the following are equivalent:

* &#92;(A&#92;) and &#92;(B&#92;) are independent.
* &#92;(P(B)=P(B&#92;vert A)&#92;)
* &#92;(P(A)=P(A&#92;vert B)&#92;)

See [slides 31]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP111/Lectures/2020-11-19.pdf) for additional examples. This covers proving independence using the definition above.

## Independence for More Than Two Events
For a finite set of events there are two different types of independence:

### Pairwise Independence
&#92;(A_1,&#92;ldots,A_n&#92;) are pairwise independent if every pair of events is independent: for all distinct &#92;(k,m&#92;)

&#92;[P(A_m&#92;cap A_k)=P(A_m)P(A_k)&#92;]

### Mutual Independence
&#92;(A_1,&#92;ldots,A_n&#92;) are mutually independent if every event is independent of any intersection of the events: for all distinct &#92;(k,m&#92;)
 
&#92;[P(A_{k1})&#92;times&#92;ldots&#92;times P(A_{k_m})=P(A_{k_1}&#92;cap&#92;ldots&#92;cap A_{k_m})&#92;]

Pairwise independence doesn't imply pairwise independence. Generally, if it isn't stated, then we are talking about **mutual independence**.

To see the proof and example of why pairwise independence does not imply mutual independence see [slide 37 onward]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP111/Lectures/2020-11-19.pdf). This example also shows examples of probability set notation.
