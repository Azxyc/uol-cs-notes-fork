In everyday language we refer to events that have nothing to do with each other as being independent.

## Definition
Events {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} are independent if:

{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}P(A\cap B)=P(A)\times P(B)\]

If {% raw %}\(P(A)\neq 0\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(P(B)\neq 0\){% endraw %}, then the following are equivalent:

* {% raw %}\(A\){% endraw %} and {% raw %}\(B\){% endraw %} are independent.
* {% raw %}\(P(B)=P(B\vert A)\){% endraw %}
* {% raw %}\(P(A)=P(A\vert B)\){% endraw %}

See [slides 31]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP111/Lectures/2020-11-19.pdf) for additional examples. This covers proving independence using the definition above.

## Independence for More Than Two Events
For a finite set of events there are two different types of independence:

### Pairwise Independence
{% raw %}\(A_1,\ldots,A_n\){% endraw %} are pairwise independent if every pair of events is independent: for all distinct {% raw %}\(k,m\){% endraw %}

{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}P(A_m\cap A_k)=P(A_m)P(A_k)\]

### Mutual Independence
{% raw %}\(A_1,\ldots,A_n\){% endraw %} are mutually independent if every event is independent of any intersection of the events: for all distinct {% raw %}\(k,m\){% endraw %}
 
{% raw %}\]{% endraw %}P(A_{k1})\times\ldots\times P(A_{k_m})=P(A_{k_1}\cap\ldots\cap A_{k_m})\]

Pairwise independence doesn't imply pairwise independence. Generally, if it isn't stated, then we are talking about **mutual independence**.

To see the proof and example of why pairwise independence does not imply mutual independence see [slide 37 onward]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/COMP111/Lectures/2020-11-19.pdf). This example also shows examples of probability set notation.
