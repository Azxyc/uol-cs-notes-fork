## First Form
If \#92;(P(A)>0\#92;), then:

\#92;[P(B\#92;vert A)=\#92;frac{P(A\#92;vert B)\#92;times P(B)}{P(A)}\#92;]

### Proof
We have:

* \#92;(P(A\#92;cap B)=P(A\#92;vert B)\#92;times P(B)\#92;)
* \#92;(P(A\#92;cap B)=P(B\#92;vert A)\#92;times P(A)\#92;)

Thus:

\#92;[P(A\#92;vert B)\#92;times P(B)=P(B\#92;vert A)\#92;times P(A)\#92;]

By dividing by \#92;(P(A)\#92;) we get:

\#92;[P(B\#92;vert A)=\#92;frac{P(A\#92;vert B)\#92;times P(B)}{P(A)}\#92;]

### Application - Diagnosis
Assume a patient walks into a doctor's office complaining of a stiff neck. The doctor knows:

* Meningitis may cause a patient to have a stiff neck 50% of the time.
	* Causal knowledge.
* The probability of having meningitis is \#92;(\#92;frac{1}{50000}\#92;)
* The probability of having a stiff neck is \#92;(\#92;frac{1}{20}\#92;)

What is the probability that the patient has meningitis?

Let \#92;(A\#92;) be the event that the patient has a stiff neck and \#92;(B\#92;) the event that they have meningitis:

\#92;[P(B\#92;vert A)=\#92;frac{P(A\#92;vert B)\#92;times P(B)}{P(A)}=\#92;frac{\#92;frac{1}{2}\#92;times \#92;frac{1}{50000}}{\#92;frac{1}{20}}=\#92;frac{1}{5000}\#92;]

* We can interpret the fact that the patient has a stiff neck as a new **observation**.
* Given this observation, we want to **classify** that patient as either having meningitis or not having meningitis.
* We have **prior** knowledge about the **unconditional** probability of having a stiff neck.
* We have **causal** knowledge about the number of times in which meningitis causes a stiff neck.
* We can then compute the diagnostic probabilities using: 

	\#92;[P(B\#92;vert A)=\#92;frac{P(A\#92;vert B)\#92;times P(B)}{P(A)}\#92;]
	
## Alternative Form
You may not have the prior probability for \#92;(A\#92;) (the observation). In this case you can use other things that you might know in this alternative form.

If \#92;(P(A)>0\#92;), then:

\#92;[P(B\#92;vert A)=\#92;frac{P(A\#92;vert B)\#92;times P(B)}{P(A\#92;vert B)\#92;times P(B)+P(A\#92;vert \#92;neg B)\#92;times P(\#92;neg B)}\#92;]

### Proof
It suffices to show:

\#92;[P(A)=P(A\#92;vert B)\#92;times P(B)+P(A\#92;vert \#92;neg B) \#92;times P(\#92;neg B)\#92;]

But this follows from:

\#92;[
\#92;begin{aligned}
P(A)&=P((A\#92;cap B)\#92;cup (A\#92;cap \#92;neg B))\#92;\#92;
&=P(A\#92;cap B)+P(A\#92;cap\#92;neg B)\#92;\#92;
&=P(A\#92;vert B)\#92;times P(B)+P(A\#92;vert \#92;neg B)\#92;times P(\#92;neg B)
\#92;end{aligned}
\#92;]

### Application - Diagnosis
Assume a drug test is:

* Positive for users 99% of the time.
* Negative for non-users 99% of the time.

Assume that 0.5% take the drug.

What is the probability that a person whose test is positive (event \#92;(A\#92;)) takes the drug (event \#92;(B\#92;))?

We have:

* \#92;(P(A\#92;vert B)=\#92;frac{99}{100}\#92;)
* \#92;(P(\#92;neg A\#92;vert \#92;neg B)=\#92;frac{99}{100}\#92;)
* \#92;(P(B)=\#92;frac{1}{200}\#92;)

Thus:

* \#92;(P(A\#92;vert \#92;neg B) =\#92;frac{1}{100}\#92;)
* \#92;(P(\#92;neg B) =\#92;frac{199}{200}\#92;)

Thus:

\#92;[P(B\#92;vert A)=\#92;frac{P(A\#92;vert B)\#92;times P(B)}{P(A\#92;vert B)\#92;times P(B)+P(A\#92;vert \#92;neg B)\#92;times P(\#92;neg B)}=\#92;frac{99}{298}\#92;approx0.33\#92;]

Due to the low value it means that it is hard to take an action based on the test. This is as a result of the low value of the people who take the drug. This results in many false positives for those that don't.
