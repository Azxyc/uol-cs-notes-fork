Let \#92;((S,P)\#92;) be a probability space. A **random variable** \#92;(F\#92;) is a function \#92;(F:S\#92;rightarrow\#92;Bbb{R}\#92;) that assigns to every \#92;(s\#92;in S\#92;) a single number \#92;(F(s)\#92;). 

In all these examples \#92;(S\#92;) is the sample space and \#92;(P\#92;) is the probability space.

* Neither a variable nor random.
	* As it is the product of a function.
* English translation of **variable casuale**.

We still assume that the sample space is finite. Thus, given a random variable \#92;(F\#92;) from some sample space \#92;(S\#92;), the set of number \#92;(r\#92;) that values of \#92;(F\#92;) is finite as well.

The event that \#92;(F\#92;) takes the value \#92;(r\#92;), that is \#92;(\#92;{s\#92;vert F(s)=r\#92;}\#92;), is denoted \#92;((F=r)\#92;). the probability \#92;((F=r)\#92;) of the even \#92;((F=r)\#92;) is then:

\#92;[P(F=r)=P(\#92;{s\#92;vert F(s)=r\#92;})\#92;]

## Example 1
Let

\#92;[S=\#92;{\#92;text{car, train, plane, ship}\#92;}\#92;]

Then the function \#92;(F:S\#92;rightarrow \#92;Bbb{R}\#92;) defined by:

\#92;[F(\#92;text{car})=1,\#92; F(\#92;text{train})=1,\#92; F(\#92;text{plane})=2,\#92; F(\#92;text{ship})=2\#92;]

is a random variable.

\#92;((F=1)\#92;) denotes the event \#92;(\#92;{s\#92;in S \#92;vert F(s) =1\#92;} = \#92;{\#92;text{car, train}\#92;}\#92;).

Defining a uniform probability space \#92;((S,P)\#92;) by setting:

\#92;[P(\#92;text{car})=P(\#92;text{train})=P(\#92;text{plane})=P(\#92;text{ship})=\#92;frac{1}{4}\#92;]

This means that we are setting each event to have the same probability.

Then \#92;(P(F=1)=P(\#92;{s\#92;in S \#92;vert F(s)=1\#92;})=P(\#92;{\#92;text{car, train}\#92;})=\#92;frac{1}{2}\#92;).

## Example 2
Suppose that I roll two dice. so the same sample space is:

\#92;[S=\#92;{1,2,3,4,5,6\#92;}^2\#92;]

and \#92;(P(ab)=\#92;frac{1}{36}\#92;) for every \#92;(ab\#92;in S\#92;).

Let 

\#92;[F(ab) = a+b\#92;]

This means that we are investigating the sum of the two dice.
{:.info}

\#92;(F\#92;) is a random variable. This variable maps the two values \#92;(ab\#92;) to the sum \#92;(a+b\#92;). 

The probability that \#92;(F=r\#92;) for a number \#92;(r\#92;) (say, 12) is given by:

\#92;[P(F=r)=P(\#92;{ab\#92;vert F(ab)=r\#92;})\#92;]

With this example:

 \#92;[P(F=12)=P(\#92;{ab\#92;vert F(ab)=12\#92;})=P(66)=\#92;frac{1}{36}\#92;]
 
## Random Variables
when defining a probability distribution \#92;(P\#92;) for a random variable \#92;(F\#92;), we often do not specify its sample space \#92;(S\#92;) by directly assign a probability to the event that \#92;(F\#92;) takes a certain value. Thus we directly define the probability:

\#92;[P(F=r)\#92;]

of the event that \#92;(F\#92;) has the value \#92;(r\#92;). Observe:

* \#92;(0\#92;leq P(F=r)\#92;leq 1\#92;)
* \#92;(\#92;sum_{r\#92;in \#92;Bbb{R}}P(F=r)=1\#92;)

Thus, the events \#92;((F=r)\#92;) behave in the same way as outcomes of a random experiment.

## Notation and Rules
### Negation
We write \#92;(\#92;neg(F=r)\#92;) for the event \#92;(\#92;{s\#92;vert F(s)\#92;neq r\#92;}\#92;). For example, assume the random variable \#92;(\#92;text{Die}\#92;) can take values \#92;(\#92;{1,2,3,4,5,6\#92;}\#92;) and:

\#92;[P(\#92;text{Die}=n)=\#92;frac{1}{6}\#92;]

for all \#92;(n\#92;in \#92;{1,2,3,4,5,6\#92;}\#92;) (thus we have a fair die). The \#92;(\#92;neg(\#92;text{Die}=1)\#92;) denotes the event:

\#92;[(\#92;text{Die}=2)\#92;vee (\#92;text{Die}=3)\#92;vee (\#92;text{Die}=4)\#92;vee (\#92;text{Die}=5)\#92;vee (\#92;text{Die}=6)\#92;]

We have the following complementation rule:

\#92;[P(\#92;neg(F=r))=1-P(F=r)\#92;]

### Intersection
We can write:

\#92;[(F_1=r_1,F_2=r_2)\#92;]

for \#92;((F_1=r_1)\#92;) and \#92;((F_2=r_2)\#92;). This takes two random variables

### Union
Two represent the function OR we can write:

\#92;[(F_1=r_1)\#92;vee(F_2=r_2)\#92;]

From this we can get the law from unions:

\#92;[
\#92;begin{aligned}
P((F_1=r_1)\#92;vee (F_2=r_2)) =& P(F_1 = r_1)+P(F_2 = r_2)\#92;\#92;
&-P(F_1=r_1,F_2=r_2)
\#92;end{aligned}
\#92;]

### Conditional Probability
if \#92;(P(F_2=r_2)\#92;neq0\#92;) then:

\#92;[P(F_1=r_1\#92;vert F_2=r_2)=\#92;frac{P(F_1=r_1,F_2=r_2)}{P(F_2=r_2)}\#92;]

This is the probability that \#92;(F_1=r_1\#92;) given that \#92;(F_2=r_2\#92;).

### Product Rule
\#92;[P(F_1=r_1,F_2=r_2)=P(F_1=r_1\#92;vert F_2=r_2)\#92;times P(F_2=r_2)\#92;]

### Symbols
Wo sometimes use symbols distinct from numbers to denote the values of random variables.

For example, for a random variable \#92;(\#92;text{Weather}\#92;) rather than using values \#92;(1,2,3,4\#92;) we use:

\#92;[\#92;text{sunny, rain, cloudy, snow}\#92;]

Thus, \#92;((\#92;text{Weather}=\#92;text{sunny})\#92;) denotes the event that it is sunny.

This is to say that random variable must give numbers as an output but we use symbols to represent these numbers.

To model a visit  to a dentist, we use the random variables \#92;(\#92;text{Toothache, Cavity}\#92;) and \#92;(\#92;text{Catch}\#92;) (the dentist's steel probe catches in the tooth) that all the take values 1 and 0 (for `True` or `False`). 

For example, (\#92;(\#92;text{Toothache}=1\#92;)) states that the person has toothache and (\#92;(\#92;text{Toothache}=0\#92;)) states that the person does not have a toothache.
