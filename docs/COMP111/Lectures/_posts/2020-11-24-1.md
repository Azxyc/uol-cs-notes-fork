Let $(S,P)$ be a probability space. A **random variable** $F$ is a function $F:S\rightarrow\Bbb{R}$ that assigns to every $s\in S$ a single number $F(s)$. 

In all these examples $S$ is the sample space and $P$ is the probability space.

* Neither a variable nor random.
	* As it is the product of a function.
* English translation of **variable casuale**.

We still assume that the sample space is finite. Thus, given a random variable $F$ from some sample space $S$, the set of number $r$ that values of $F$ is finite as well.

The event that $F$ takes the value $r$, that is $\\\{s\vert F(s)=r\\\}$, is denoted $(F=r)$. the probability $(F=r)$ of the even $(F=r)$ is then:

$$P(F=r)=P(\\\{s\vert F(s)=r\\\})$$

## Example 1
Let

$$S=\\\{\text{car, train, plane, ship}\\\}$$

Then the function $F:S\rightarrow \Bbb{R}$ defined by:

$$F(\text{car})=1,\ F(\text{train})=1,\ F(\text{plane})=2,\ F(\text{ship})=2$$

is a random variable.

$(F=1)$ denotes the event $\\\{s\in S \vert F(s) =1\\\} = \\\{\text{car, train}\\\}$.

Defining a uniform probability space $(S,P)$ by setting:

$$P(\text{car})=P(\text{train})=P(\text{plane})=P(\text{ship})=\frac{1}{4}$$

This means that we are setting each event to have the same probability.

Then $P(F=1)=P(\\\{s\in S \vert F(s)=1\\\})=P(\\\{\text{car, train}\\\})=\frac{1}{2}$.

## Example 2
Suppose that I roll two dice. so the same sample space is:

$$S=\\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\\}^2$$

and $P(ab)=\frac{1}{36}$ for every $ab\in S$.

Let 

$$F(ab) = a+b$$

This means that we are investigating the sum of the two dice.
{:.info}

$F$ is a random variable. This variable maps the two values $ab$ to the sum $a+b$. 

The probability that $F=r$ for a number $r$ (say, 12) is given by:

$$P(F=r)=P(\\\{ab\vert F(ab)=r\\\})$$

With this example:

 $$P(F=12)=P(\\\{ab\vert F(ab)=12\\\})=P(66)=\frac{1}{36}$$
 
## Random Variables
when defining a probability distribution $P$ for a random variable $F$, we often do not specify its sample space $S$ by directly assign a probability to the event that $F$ takes a certain value. Thus we directly define the probability:

$$P(F=r)$$

of the event that $F$ has the value $r$. Observe:

* $0\leq P(F=r)\leq 1$
* $\sum_{r\in \Bbb{R}}P(F=r)=1$

Thus, the events $(F=r)$ behave in the same way as outcomes of a random experiment.

## Notation and Rules
### Negation
We write $\neg(F=r)$ for the event $\\\{s\vert F(s)\neq r\\\}$. For example, assume the random variable $\text{Die}$ can take values $\\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\\}$ and:

$$P(\text{Die}=n)=\frac{1}{6}$$

for all $n\in \\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\\}$ (thus we have a fair die). The $\neg(\text{Die}=1)$ denotes the event:

$$(\text{Die}=2)\vee (\text{Die}=3)\vee (\text{Die}=4)\vee (\text{Die}=5)\vee (\text{Die}=6)$$

We have the following complementation rule:

$$P(\neg(F=r))=1-P(F=r)$$

### Intersection
We can write:

$$(F_1=r_1,F_2=r_2)$$

for $(F_1=r_1)$ and $(F_2=r_2)$. This takes two random variables

### Union
Two represent the function OR we can write:

$$(F_1=r_1)\vee(F_2=r_2)$$

From this we can get the law from unions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P((F_1=r_1)\vee (F_2=r_2)) =& P(F_1 = r_1)+P(F_2 = r_2)\\
&-P(F_1=r_1,F_2=r_2)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Conditional Probability
if $P(F_2=r_2)\neq0$ then:

$$P(F_1=r_1\vert F_2=r_2)=\frac{P(F_1=r_1,F_2=r_2)}{P(F_2=r_2)}$$

This is the probability that $F_1=r_1$ given that $F_2=r_2$.

### Product Rule
$$P(F_1=r_1,F_2=r_2)=P(F_1=r_1\vert F_2=r_2)\times P(F_2=r_2)$$

### Symbols
Wo sometimes use symbols distinct from numbers to denote the values of random variables.

For example, for a random variable $\text{Weather}$ rather than using values $1,2,3,4$ we use:

$$\text{sunny, rain, cloudy, snow}$$

Thus, $(\text{Weather}=\text{sunny})$ denotes the event that it is sunny.

This is to say that random variable must give numbers as an output but we use symbols to represent these numbers.

To model a visit  to a dentist, we use the random variables $\text{Toothache, Cavity}$ and $\text{Catch}$ (the dentist's steel probe catches in the tooth) that all the take values 1 and 0 (for `True` or `False`). 

For example, ($\text{Toothache}=1$) states that the person has toothache and ($\text{Toothache}=0$) states that the person does not have a toothache.
