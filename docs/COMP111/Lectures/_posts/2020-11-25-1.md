## Examples of Probabilistic Models
To model a domain using probability theory, one first introduces the relevant random variable. We have seen two basic examples:

* The weather domain could be modelled using the single random variable \$$\text{Weather}\$$ with values:

	$$(\text{sunny},\text{rain},\text{cloudy},\text{snow})$$

* The dentist domain could be modelled using the random variables \$$\text{Toothache, Cavity}\$$ and \$$\text{Catch}\$$ with values 0 and 1 for True or False. We might be interested in:

$$P(\text{Cavity}=1\vert\text{Toothache}=1,\text{Catch}=1)$$

## Probability Distribution of a Single Random Variable
The probability distribution for a random variable gives the probabilities of all the possible values of the random variable.

For example let \$$\text{Weather}\$$ be a random variable with values:

$$(\text{sunny},\text{rain},\text{cloudy},\text{snow})$$

such that its probability distribution is given by:

* \$$P(\text{Weather}=\text{sunny})=0.7\$$
* \$$P(\text{Weather}=\text{rain})=0.2\$$
* \$$P(\text{Weather}=\text{cloudy})=0.08\$$
* \$$P(\text{Weather}=\text{snow})=0.02\$$

Assume the order of the values is fixed. The we write instead:

$$\mathbf{P}(\text{Weather})=(0.7,0.2,0.008,0.02)$$

Where the bold \$$\mathbf{P}\$$ indicates that the result is a vector of number representing the individual values of \$$\text{Weather}\$$.

We can write the values as a vector in the case that the properties are ordered.

## Joint Probability Distribution
This is the case when you are using many random variables.

Let \$$F_1,\ldots,F_k\$$ be random variable. A joint probability distribution for:

$$F_1,\ldots,F_k$$

gives the probabilities:

$$P(F_1=r_1,\ldots,F_k=r_k)$$

for the event:

$$(F_1=r_1)\text{ and } \cdots \text{ and }(F_k=r_k)$$

that \$$F_1\$$ takes value \$$r_1\$$, \$$F_2\$$ take value \$$r_2\$$, and so on up to \$$k\$$ , for all possible values \$$r_1,\ldots,r_k\$$.

The joint probability distribution is denotes \$$\mathbf{P}(F_1,\ldots,K_k)\$$.

### Example
A possible joint probabillity distribution \$$\mathbf{P}(\text{Weather, Cavity})\$$ for the random varables \$$\text{Weather}\$$ and \$$\text{Cavity}\$$ is given by the following table:

| \$$\text{Weather}=\$$ | \$$\text{sunny}\$$ | \$$\text{rain}\$$ | \$$\text{cloudy}\$$ | \$$\text{snow}\$$ |
| :-: |  :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| \$$\text{Cavity}=1\$$ | 0.144 | 0.02 | 0.016 | 0.02 |
| \$$\text{Cavity}=0\$$ | 0.576 | 0.08 | 0.064 | 0.08 |

For this to be plausible we should know that the two events are independent of each-other.

### Full Joint Probability Distribution

A full joint probability distribution:

$$\mathbf{P}(F_1,\ldots,K_k)$$

is a joint probability distribution for all relavent random variables \$$F_1,\ldots,F_k\$$ for a domain of interest.

Every probability quesetion about a domain can be answered by tehf ull joint distributin because the probability of every evenint is a sum of the probabilities:

$$P(F_1=r_1,\ldots,F_k=r_k)$$

The \$$r_1,\ldots,r_k\$$ are often called data points or sample points.

#### Example
Assume the random variables \$$\text{Toothache, Cavity, Catch}\$$ fully describe a visit to a dentist. 

The a full joint probability distribution is gien by the following table:

| | \$$\text{Toothache}=1\$$ | \$$\text{Toothache}=1\$$ | \$$\text{Toothache}=0\$$ | \$$\text{Toothache}=0\$$ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | \$$\text{Catch}=1\$$ |  \$$\text{Catch}=0\$$ |  \$$\text{Catch}=1\$$ |  \$$\text{Catch}=0\$$ | 
| \$$\text{Cavity}=1\$$ | 0.108 | 0.012 | 0.072 | 0.008 |
| \$$\text{Cavity}=0\$$ | 0.016 | 0.064 | 0.144 | 0.576 |
