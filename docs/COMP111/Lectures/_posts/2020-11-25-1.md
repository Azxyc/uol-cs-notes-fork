## Examples of Probabilistic Models
To model a domain using probability theory, one first introduces the relevant random variable. We have seen two basic examples:

* The weather domain could be modelled using the single random variable \#92;(\#92;text{Weather}\#92;) with values:

	\#92;[(\#92;text{sunny},\#92;text{rain},\#92;text{cloudy},\#92;text{snow})\#92;]

* The dentist domain could be modelled using the random variables \#92;(\#92;text{Toothache, Cavity}\#92;) and \#92;(\#92;text{Catch}\#92;) with values 0 and 1 for True or False. We might be interested in:

\#92;[P(\#92;text{Cavity}=1\#92;vert\#92;text{Toothache}=1,\#92;text{Catch}=1)\#92;]

## Probability Distribution of a Single Random Variable
The probability distribution for a random variable gives the probabilities of all the possible values of the random variable.

For example let \#92;(\#92;text{Weather}\#92;) be a random variable with values:

\#92;[(\#92;text{sunny},\#92;text{rain},\#92;text{cloudy},\#92;text{snow})\#92;]

such that its probability distribution is given by:

* \#92;(P(\#92;text{Weather}=\#92;text{sunny})=0.7\#92;)
* \#92;(P(\#92;text{Weather}=\#92;text{rain})=0.2\#92;)
* \#92;(P(\#92;text{Weather}=\#92;text{cloudy})=0.08\#92;)
* \#92;(P(\#92;text{Weather}=\#92;text{snow})=0.02\#92;)

Assume the order of the values is fixed. The we write instead:

\#92;[\#92;mathbf{P}(\#92;text{Weather})=(0.7,0.2,0.008,0.02)\#92;]

Where the bold \#92;(\#92;mathbf{P}\#92;) indicates that the result is a vector of number representing the individual values of \#92;(\#92;text{Weather}\#92;).

We can write the values as a vector in the case that the properties are ordered.

## Joint Probability Distribution
This is the case when you are using many random variables.

Let \#92;(F_1,\#92;ldots,F_k\#92;) be random variable. A joint probability distribution for:

\#92;[F_1,\#92;ldots,F_k\#92;]

gives the probabilities:

\#92;[P(F_1=r_1,\#92;ldots,F_k=r_k)\#92;]

for the event:

\#92;[(F_1=r_1)\#92;text{ and } \#92;cdots \#92;text{ and }(F_k=r_k)\#92;]

that \#92;(F_1\#92;) takes value \#92;(r_1\#92;), \#92;(F_2\#92;) take value \#92;(r_2\#92;), and so on up to \#92;(k\#92;) , for all possible values \#92;(r_1,\#92;ldots,r_k\#92;).

The joint probability distribution is denotes \#92;(\#92;mathbf{P}(F_1,\#92;ldots,K_k)\#92;).

### Example
A possible joint probabillity distribution \#92;(\#92;mathbf{P}(\#92;text{Weather, Cavity})\#92;) for the random varables \#92;(\#92;text{Weather}\#92;) and \#92;(\#92;text{Cavity}\#92;) is given by the following table:

| \#92;(\#92;text{Weather}=\#92;) | \#92;(\#92;text{sunny}\#92;) | \#92;(\#92;text{rain}\#92;) | \#92;(\#92;text{cloudy}\#92;) | \#92;(\#92;text{snow}\#92;) |
| :-: |  :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| \#92;(\#92;text{Cavity}=1\#92;) | 0.144 | 0.02 | 0.016 | 0.02 |
| \#92;(\#92;text{Cavity}=0\#92;) | 0.576 | 0.08 | 0.064 | 0.08 |

For this to be plausible we should know that the two events are independent of each-other.

### Full Joint Probability Distribution

A full joint probability distribution:

\#92;[\#92;mathbf{P}(F_1,\#92;ldots,K_k)\#92;]

is a joint probability distribution for all relavent random variables \#92;(F_1,\#92;ldots,F_k\#92;) for a domain of interest.

Every probability quesetion about a domain can be answered by tehf ull joint distributin because the probability of every evenint is a sum of the probabilities:

\#92;[P(F_1=r_1,\#92;ldots,F_k=r_k)\#92;]

The \#92;(r_1,\#92;ldots,r_k\#92;) are often called data points or sample points.

#### Example
Assume the random variables \#92;(\#92;text{Toothache, Cavity, Catch}\#92;) fully describe a visit to a dentist. 

The a full joint probability distribution is gien by the following table:

| | \#92;(\#92;text{Toothache}=1\#92;) | \#92;(\#92;text{Toothache}=1\#92;) | \#92;(\#92;text{Toothache}=0\#92;) | \#92;(\#92;text{Toothache}=0\#92;) |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | \#92;(\#92;text{Catch}=1\#92;) |  \#92;(\#92;text{Catch}=0\#92;) |  \#92;(\#92;text{Catch}=1\#92;) |  \#92;(\#92;text{Catch}=0\#92;) | 
| \#92;(\#92;text{Cavity}=1\#92;) | 0.108 | 0.012 | 0.072 | 0.008 |
| \#92;(\#92;text{Cavity}=0\#92;) | 0.016 | 0.064 | 0.144 | 0.576 |
