%	\item{Simple reflex agents have no memory and make simple decisions based on what their sensors can see at that point in time.
%
%		Model based reflex agents have a memory that helps deal with partially observable situations. To make better use of this memory they have a model of how the world evolves and how it's actions affect the world.
%
%		Goal based agents involve all the previous features but select appropriate actions to achieve an end goal. This means that it plans what to do over a long sequence of actions but also means that the agent may not know what to do at any particular time.
%
%		Utility-based agents make use of a utility function to compare how desirable the effect of a particular action will be. The agent will maximise this function to create the most desirable outcome from its actions
%
%		Learning agents find ways form maximising with utility function based on previous experience. Learning agent have a learning element that informs the agent how to act based on past experience of maximising its utility.}
