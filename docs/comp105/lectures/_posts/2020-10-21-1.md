## Tuples
A tuples allows us to bind two or more values together:

```haskell
(1,2)
("A", "few", "words")
(6, "six")
```

* Tuples can have any size but must be at least 2. 
* The size should be thought of as being fixed as it is not easy to change  the length of a tuple. 
* Tuples can mix types.

### Example Functions
#### Taking Tuples as Input
```haskell
f (x, y) = x
```

This will take a tuple with the elements `x` and `y` and will return the first element of the tuple.

#### Returning Tuples as Output
```haskell
f x y = (max x y, min x y)
```

### Syntax
```haskell
f x y = x + y
g (x, y) = x + y
```

Both will give the same output but the recommendation is to use the Haskell method instead of always passing tuples.

### Exercises
1. ```haskell
	exercise1 x = (x / 10, 100 * x)
	```
	
1. ```haskell
	exercise2 (x, y, z) = x + y + z
	```
	
1. ```haskell
	exercise3 (x, y, z) = (z, y, x)
	```
