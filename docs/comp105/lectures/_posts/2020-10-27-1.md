## List Recursion
Lists have a **head** and a **tail**. We use these command and pattern matching to recurse lists. Generally list recursions use the empty list `[]` as part of the base case.

### Consuming Lists

```haskell
sum' []		= 0 
sum' (x:xs)	= x + sum' xs
```

* The base case is the empty list.
* The recursive rule breaks the list into its head and tail.

```haskell
length' []		= 0
length' (_:xs)	= 1 + length' xs
```

* This time the head of the list isn't used.

#### Building Lists
We can also build lists using recursion.

```haskell
down_from 0	= []
down_from x	= x : down_from (x-1)
```

This will produce a list counting down from the number provided until  zero is reached.

#### Transforming Lists
If you want to consume and build a list in one go it is called transforming a list.

```haskell
square_list []		= []
square_list (x:xs)	= x * x : square_list xs
```

This list will square each value and add it recursively onto the list.

The defining feature of transforming lists is that the base case has an input of `[]` which is equal to the output of `[]`. 

## Exercises
1. ```haskell
	product' []		= 1
	product' (x:xs)	= x * product' xs
	```
	
1. ```haskell
	upToTen 10	= 10
	upToTen x 	= x : upToTen (x + 1)
	```
	
1. ```haskell
	halveList [] 		= []
	halveList (x:xs) 	= (x / 2) : halveList (xs)
	```
