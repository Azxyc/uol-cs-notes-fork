## The Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is a shift method of encoding. This shifts every letter forward by three and wraps around when `z` is reached.

There is no particular reason to shift by three and you can shift by any number between zero and 25. Shifting by 13 would be a ROT13.

### Working with Characters
The `Data.Char` package has some useful functions for working with characters. 

* The `ord` function takes a character and returns its ASCII value.
* The `chr` function turns an ASCII value into a character.

To import a package use the line:

```
import ...
```

using the name of the package you want to import.

### Implementation
