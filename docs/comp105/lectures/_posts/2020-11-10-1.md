## More Type Classes
### `show`
This function converts other types to strings. However, it can only take the type class of `Show` into a string:

```haskell
show :: Show a => a -> a
```

`Show` contains:

* All basic types.
* All tuples of show-able types.
* All lists of show-able types.

### `read`
This converts strings to other types, provided they are formatted correctly:

```haskell
read "123" :: Int
```

In this case the use of `::` is necessary to tell Haskell what type the function should return.

In cases where type inference can be used, the `::` is not required:

```haskell
not (read "False")
```

The type of `read` is the type class `Read`:

```haskell
read :: Read a => a -> a
```

`Read` contains:

* All basic types.
* All tuples of readable types.
* All lists of readable types.

### Ordered Types
The type class to compare two objects by inequality is `Ord`. This is required for using functions such as `>`.

```haskell
(>) :: Ord a -> a -> a -> Bool
```

All basic types can be compared including tuples and lists. Tuples and lists are compared **lexicographically** (similar to alphabetically ordering words).

## Exercises
1. `showTuple :: (Show a, Show b) => (a, b) -> [Char]`
1. `addThree :: (Num a, Read a) => String -> a`
1. `headLt10 :: (Num a, Ord a) => [a] -> Bool`
