## `Maybe`

```haskell
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
```

```haskell
> :t Just "hello"
Maybe [Char]
> :t Just False
Maybe Bool
> :t Nothing
Maybe a
```

From here you can see that when you call the `Just` constructor you force the type variable `a` to be a particular type and if you call `Nothing` then no type is assigned to `a`.

The `Maybe` type is used in pure functional code that **might fail**.

```haskell
safe_head [] = Nothing
safe_head (x:_) = Just x
```

```haskell
> safe_head [1,2,3]
Just 1 
> safe_head []
Nothing
```

Given that the function will always give an output this means that it wont give an exception and crash the program.

### Example

```haskell
safe_get_heads list =
    let
        mapped = map safe_head list
        filtered = filter (/=Nothing) mapped
        unjust = (\ x -> case x of Just a -> a)
    in
        map unjust filtered
```

```haskell
> safe_get_heads [[],[1],[2,3]]
[1,2]
```

This code will not crash in the event that an empty list is given to head.

## Exceptions in Haskell
Haskell does include support for exceptions

```haskell
> head []
*** Exception: Prelude.head: empty list
```

Exceptions are not pure functional:

* Every function returns exactly one value.
* You can't catch exceptions in pure functional code.
* Exceptions are mostly used in IO code.

The `Maybe` type provides a way to do exception-like behaviour in pure functional code.

Can this function fail for some inputs?

* Use the `Maybe` type.

Exceptions should only be used in IO code:

* File not found, could not connect to server, etc.
* These are unpredictable events.

## `Either`

```haskell
data Either' a b = Left a | Right b
```

```haskell
> :t Left 'a'
Either Char 'b'
> :t Right 'b'
Either a Char
```

The `Either` type is useful if you want to store different types in the same list:

```haskell
is_left (Left _)    = True
is_left _           = False
```

```haskell
> let list = [Left "one", Right 2, Left "three", Right 4]
> map is_left list
[True,False,True,False]
```

### Example - Filtering off `Left`

```haskell
get_lefts list = 
    let
        filtered = filter is_left list
        unleft = (\ (Left x) -> x)
    in
        map unleft filtered
```

```haskell
> get_lefts list
["one","three"]
```

### Example - Squaring Mixed Number Types

```haskell
square (Left x) = Left (x ** 2)
square (Rightx) = Right (x ^ 2)
```

```haskell
> let nums = [Left pi, Right (4::Int), Left 2.7182]
> map square nums
[Left 9.86,Right 16,Left 7.38]
```

### Meaningful Error Messages
`Either` can also be used to give detailed error messages.

```haskell
safe_head_either []     = Right "empty list"
safe_head_either (x:xs) = Left x
```

```haskell
> safe_head_either []
Right "empty list"
> safe_head_either [1,2,3]
Left 1
```

This is required as a function can't return values of two different types.

## Exercises
1. ```haskell
    safeTail :: [a] -> Maybe [a]
    safeTail []     = Nothing
    safeTail x:xs   = Just xs
    ```

1. ```haskell
    safeDiv :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int
    safeDiv _ 0 = Nothing
    safeDiv x y = Just (div x y)
    ```
    
1. ```haskell
    safeGet :: [a] -> Int Either a String
    safeGet x y
        | x < 0 = Right "Negative index."
        | length x <= y = Right "Index too large."
        | otherwise = Left (x !! y)
    ```
