## Writing IO Code
We can write our own IO actions:

```haskell
print_two :: String -> String -> IO ()
Print_two s1 s2 = putStrLn (s1 ++ s2)
```

```haskell
> print_two "abc" "def"
abcdef
```

Note that the return type is `IO ()`.

### Combining Multiple IO Calls
The `do` syntax allows us to combine multiple IO actions.

```haskell
get_and_print :: IO ()
get_and_print =
    do
        x <- getLine
        y <- getLine
        putStrLn (x ++ " " ++ y)
```

This syntax allows us two write a sequence of statements that will be executed in order.

You could also write this with the following syntax:

```haskell
get_and_print :: IO ()
get_and_print = do
    x <- getLine
    y <- getLine
    putStrLn (x ++ " " ++ y)
```

#### The `do` Syntax
A `do` block has the following syntax:

```haskell
do
    v1 <- [IO action]
    v2 <- [IO action]
    ...
    vk <- [IO action]
    [IO action]
```

* `v1` through `vk` unbox the results of IO actions.
* The final IO action is the return value.

The `v <-` portion can be skipped if you are using an IO action purely for the side effect.

#### `let` in `do` Blocks
`let` expressions can be used inside `do` block in order to complete pure computations:

```haskell
add_one :: IO ()
add_one =
    do
        n <- getLine
        let num = (read n) :: Int
            out = show (num + 1)
        putStrLn out
```

In a `do` block you can type anything out that you would type into the command line of GHCI.

#### `if` in `do` Blocks

```haskell
guess :: IO ()
guess = do
    x <- getLine
    if x == "42"
        then putStrLn "Correct!"
        else putStrLn "You are very wrong."
```

Both branches of the `if` mut have the same type.

### `do` Blocks
`do` blocks let you sequence multiple actions:

* Works with IO actions.
* Will not work in pure functional code.

Functional programs consist of:

* A small amount of IO code.
* A large amount of pure functional node.

Don't try to write your entire program in IO code.

### Putting Values in the IO Box
Sometimes we need to pus a pure value into `IO`.

* We can use the `return` function to do this.

```haskell
> :t "hello"
"hello" :: [Char]

> :t return "hello"
IO [Char]
```

```haskell
example :: IO String
example = do
    x <- getLine
    return (tail x)
```

You must use return to get the value out of an impure function.

```haskell
print_if_short :: String -> IO ()
print_if_short str =
    if length str <= 2
        then putStrLn str
        else return ()
```

Both sides of the `if` must have the type `IO ()`:

* So we use `return ()` in the `else` part.

#### `return`
This function is not the same as in imperative languages `return` **does not stop execution**. It just convert pure values to IO values.

### `Monad`
The type of `return` mentions monads.

```haskell
> :t return
return :: Monad m => a -> m a
```

This is because IO is a **monad**.
 
* Whenever you see `Monad m =>` substitute `IO` for `m`.
* So `return :: a -> IO a`
 
You don't need to know anything about monads for COMP105.

## Exercises
1. ```haskell
    doubleEcho :: IO ()
    doubleEcho = do
        x <- getLine
        putStrLn x
        putStrLn x
    ```
    
1. ```haskell
    firstWord :: IO ()
    firstWord = do
        string <- getLine
        if (words string) == []
            then putStrLn ""
            else putStrLn (head . words $ string)
    ```
    
1. ```haskell
    printEven :: Int -> IO ()
    printEven x = if (even x) 
        then (putStrLn x)
        else return ()
    ```
    
    This doesn't need to be done in a `do` block as it is just one line.
