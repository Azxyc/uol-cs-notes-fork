## Lazy Lists

Lists are never evaluated until they are needed. This means that `take 1 [1..10]` is just as efficient as `take 1 [1..1000]`.

### Infinite Lists

The reason why we are able to make infinite lists is a result of lazy evaluation. As evaluation only happens right at the end, the program won't hang by trying to evaluate it in the background. You can make simple infinite list like so:

```haskell
[1,1..]
```

Or like this:

```haskell
all1s :: [Int]
all1s = 1 : all1s
```

As a result of this you are able to do infinite computations on infinite lists provided that you can resolve to a finite value.

```haskell
all2s = zipwith (+) all1s all1s
```

This will produce an infinite sum of infinite lists.

#### Example

```haskell
sieve (x:xs) = x : filter (\y -> y `mod` x /= 0) (sieve xs)
```

You can then use this function to define other useful infinite lists:

```haskell
primes = sieve [2..]
```

```haskell
> take 10 primes
[2,3,]
> primes !! 1000
7927
```

## The `$` Operator

The `$` function evaluates a function.

Take this function and apply it to this argument

### Strict Evaluation
The `$!` operator makes Haskell evaluate strictly:

```haskell
> let f x = 1

> f $ undefined
1

> f $! undefined
Error
```

For most code you won't notice the difference but it can change the error outputs.
