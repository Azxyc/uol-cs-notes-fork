The group unanimously agreed to make an AI butler in a similar market to Siri.

## Product Name

The name was decided to be a Greek letter and a colour to imitate modern startup companies.

&#92;(\kappa&#92;) was chosen as the Greek letter Kappa. The colour chosen was green. 

This made logo design as simple as a green kappa.
