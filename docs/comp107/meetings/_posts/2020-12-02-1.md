## Identifying Submission Requirements
We had a look at the marking criteria to identify the requirements for the report.

1. Identify at least three users or view which provide three different perspectives on the model?
1. For the user perspectives create 4 - 5 different user stories.
1. Group them in a number of iterations.
1. Draw out the user stories in an EER diagram. Over various iterations.
	* Draw EER diagram for each user story.
	* Merge those together into user perspectives
	* Merge those together into one EER diagram for the butler.
1. Make sure to include all EER diagram features in our diagrams to make them as complete as possible.
	
	Find out about tableaux testing to check if your design produces spurious records.
	{:.warning}
1. Additionally there should be descriptions that tie the EER diagrams together.

## Method of Collaboration
We should collaborate in a collaborative word document. The link will be in the chat and I will put it [here](https://theuniversityofliverpool-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/pslrimme_liverpool_ac_uk/EeQ192A2au5BiL3bXaAfThYBg70DZD49EASdD04O2dLZYQ?e=yVUTC8) too.

We should base our document on the following [template](https://liverpool.instructure.com/courses/17251/files/1391047/download?wrap=1).
