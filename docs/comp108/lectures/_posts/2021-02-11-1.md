title: COMP108 - Pseudo Code - 2
tags: COMP108 Lectures

This lecture follows through some examples of solving particular problems in pseudo code. The slides for this lecture are [available here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/comp108/lectures/2021-02-11-1.pdf).

## Factors of $x$ but Not Factors of $y$
In this example we find the factors of $x$ and $y$ and subtract the elements in the $y$ list from the $x$ list.

## Lowest Common Multiple
This example iterates through all numbers until it finds one that satisfies `mod = 0` for both numbers.

Using breaks in a loop is not a good practice as it diminishes readability.
