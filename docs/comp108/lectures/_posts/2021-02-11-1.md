This lecture follows through some examples of solving particular problems in pseudo code. The slides for this lecture are [available here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/comp108/lectures/2021-02-11-1.pdf).

## Factors of &#92;(x&#92;) but Not Factors of &#92;(y&#92;)
In this example we find the factors of &#92;(x&#92;) and &#92;(y&#92;) and subtract the elements in the &#92;(y&#92;) list from the &#92;(x&#92;) list.

## Lowest Common Multiple
This example iterates through all numbers until it finds one that satisfies `mod = 0` for both numbers.

Using breaks in a loop is not a good practice as it diminishes readability.
