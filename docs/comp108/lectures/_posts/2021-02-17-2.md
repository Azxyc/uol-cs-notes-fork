## Powers
To find the time complexity of an algorithm look at the loops:

```
count = 0
for i = 1 to x do
	for j = 1 to y do
		for k = 1 to z do
			count = count + 1
```

For this loop the time complexity is &#92;(O(xyz)&#92;). You can see that the variable relates to the time complexity.

Here is another example:

```
i = 1
while i <= n do
begin 
	j = i
	while j <= n do
		j = j + 1
	i = i + 1
end
```

The time complexity for this loop is &#92;(O(n^2)&#92;). This is as a result of the time complexity of:

&#92;[\frac{n\times(n+1)}{2}&#92;]

The highest term in this equation is &#92;(n^2&#92;).

## Logs
Here is another algorithm:

```
i = 1
count = 0 while i < n do
begin 
	i = i * 2
	count = count + 1
end
output count
```

This is the trace table for this algorithm:

* Suppose &#92;(n=8&#92;)
	
	| Iteration | `i` before | `i` after | `count` |
	| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
	| Before Loop | | 1 | 0 |
	| 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 |
	| 2 | 2 | 4 | 2 |
	| 3 | 4 | 8 | ***3*** |
	
* Suppose &#92;(n=32&#92;)
	
	| Iteration | `i` before | `i` after | `count` |
	| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
	| Before Loop | | 1 | 0 |
	| 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 |
	| 2 | 2 | 4 | 2 |
	| 3 | 4 | 8 | 3 |
	| 4 | 8 | 16 | 4 |
	| 5 | 16 | 32 | ***5*** |
	
We can see by comparing &#92;(n&#92;) to the iterations that this algorithm is not linear.

To find the count that gives &#92;(n&#92;) we would need to calculate:

&#92;[2^\text{count}=n&#92;]

Therefore this algorithm has logarithmic time complexity:

&#92;[O(\log n)&#92;]

Don't presume, when you see a loop, that the time complexity is polynomial.
