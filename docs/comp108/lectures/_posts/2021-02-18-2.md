title: Arrays - Binary Search

This method is a moire efficient way of searching but only when the sequence of numbers is **sorted**.

## Input
A sequence of $n$ sorted numbers in **ascending** order and a target number `key`.

## Method

1. Compare `key` with number in the middle.
1. Then focus on only the first half or the second half, dependant on whether `key` is smaller or greater than the middle number.
1. Reduce the amount of number to be searched by half.

### Example

| 3 | 7 | 11 | 12 | *15* | 19 | 24 | 33 | 41 | 55 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  |  |  |  | *24* |  |  |  |  |  |

Go for lower if there is no middle. Consistency is key.

|  |  |  |  |  | 19 | 24 | *33* | 41 | 55 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | *24* |  |  |

|  |  |  |  |  | *19* | 24 |  |  |  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  |  |  |  |  | *24* |  |  |  |  |

|  |  |  |  |  |  | *24* |  |  |  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  |  |  |  |  |  | *24* |  |  |  |

Found

If the `key` is not in the array you can conclude the number is not there when comparing to the last digit.

## Pseudo Code

```
first = 1
last = n
found = false
while first <= last &&	found == false do
begin
	mid = floor((first + last) / 2)
	if A[mid] == key then
		found == true
	else if A[mid] > key then	// these two cases will trip first <= last
		last = mid - 1
	else A[mid] < key	
		first = mid + 1
end
if found == true then
	output "Found"
else
	output "Not Found"
```

## Time Complexity
This search is generally quicker than linear search.

* Best case:
	* `key` is the middle number.
	* $O(1)$
* Worst case:
	* The `key` is not in the list. 
	* At most $\lceil\log n\rceil+1$ comparisons.
		* $O(\log n)$
	
		This is as every comparison reduces the amount of numbers by at least half. We are asking: "How many times are we dividing $n$ by 2 to get 1?"
