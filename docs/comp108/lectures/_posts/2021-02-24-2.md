Suppose we have data of daily rainfall for a year. Find the maximum monthly average rainfall over a year.

* Lets assume that there are $d$ days in a month and $m$ months in a year.

We could store rainfall data in a 2D array of size $m\times d$:

| | 1 | 2 | ... | $d$ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| ... |  | | | |
| $m$ | | | | |

`rainfall[i][j]` stores rainfall of month $i$ and day $j$.

You can split the problem into the following questions:

1. What is the average rainfall of month $i$?
1. What is the maximum average?

## Average of Month $i$

```
j = 1
sum = 0
while j <= d do
begin
	sum += rainfall[i][j]	# ask for i
	j++
end
average = sum / d
```

This is the **nested** portion of the loop. $i$ should be incremented outside.

## Maximum of the Averages

```
m = 0
i = i
while i <= m do
begin
	sum = 0
	for j = 1 to d do
		sum += rainfall[i][j]
	average = sum / d
	if average > m then 
		m = average
	i++
end
output m
```

### Time Complexity
The nested portion has a time complexity of $O(d)$. This is repeated $m$ times giving an overall time complexity of:

$$O(m\times d)$$
