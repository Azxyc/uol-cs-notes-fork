title: Queues & Stacks - 1

* **Arrays** - Alow random access to data.
* **Queues** - FIFO
* **Stack** - LIFO

## Queues
There are two operations on a queue:

* Enqueue - Insert element to the tail.
* Dequeue - Delete element from the head.

The **head** points to the first element and the **tail** points to the location where data should be enqueued.

The actions are completed as follows:

* Enqueue
	* Save the data to `Q[tail]` and increment `tail` by 1.
* Dequeue
	* Retrieve data from `Q[head]` and increment `head` by 1. 
	
Need to check if queue is **empty before dequeue** or **full before enqueue**.

### Pseudo Code - Infinite Size

```
Enqueue(Q,x)
Q[tail] = x
tail++
```

```
Dequeue(Q)
if head == tail then # both pointers at same place
	Queue is EMPTY
else begin
	x = Q[head]
	head++
	return x
end
```

### Pseudo Code - Limited Size

```
Enqueue(Q,x)
if tail > size then
	Queue is FULL
else begin
	Q[tail] = x
	tail++
end
```

### Looping
In order to make use of free lower blocks the indexes must wrap around. This will give the following methods:

* Enqueue
	* After incrementing `tail`, if it exceeds `size`, then reset it to 1. 
	* Same for checking full or not.
	* If indexes are from 0 to `size - 1` you can use `%`.
* Dequeue
	* After incrementing `head`, if it exceeds `size`, then reset it to 1.
	* If indices are from 0 to `size - 1`, you can use `%`.
