## Time Complexity
For a list with $n$ elements the following operations have the following time complexity:

* Traversing: $O(n)$
* Searching:
	* Unsorted: $O(n)$
	* Sorted: $O(n)$
* Insertion/Deletion:
	* Head/Tail: $O(1)$
	* Middle: $O(n)$
	* Finding the location may take $O(n)$ time.
	
## Memory Management

* Memory needs to be allocated for a new node.
* We should free any object that is no longer used (after we delete a node).
* In some systems, a **garbage collector** is responsible for storage management.

## Arrays v.s. Lists 

* Arrays
	* Easy to access, one can access any element in a single access by its index.
	* Size needs to be predetermined, may waste space.
	* If we want to insert an element in the middle, needs to **shift** the rest.
* Linked Lists
	* Needs to traverse the list to access elements in the middle.
	* Does not need to predefine size, it's flexible to add elements.
	* Once we find the location to insert, we can insert without moving the rest, only need to alter a few pointers.
