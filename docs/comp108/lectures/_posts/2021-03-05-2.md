## Time Complexity
For a list with &#92;(n&#92;) elements the following operations have the following time complexity:

* Traversing: &#92;(O(n)&#92;)
* Searching:
	* Unsorted: &#92;(O(n)&#92;)
	* Sorted: &#92;(O(n)&#92;)
* Insertion/Deletion:
	* Head/Tail: &#92;(O(1)&#92;)
	* Middle: &#92;(O(n)&#92;)
	* Finding the location may take &#92;(O(n)&#92;) time.
	
## Memory Management

* Memory needs to be allocated for a new node.
* We should free any object that is no longer used (after we delete a node).
* In some systems, a **garbage collector** is responsible for storage management.

## Arrays v.s. Lists 

* Arrays
	* Easy to access, one can access any element in a single access by its index.
	* Size needs to be predetermined, may waste space.
	* If we want to insert an element in the middle, needs to **shift** the rest.
* Linked Lists
	* Needs to traverse the list to access elements in the middle.
	* Does not need to predefine size, it's flexible to add elements.
	* Once we find the location to insert, we can insert without moving the rest, only need to alter a few pointers.
