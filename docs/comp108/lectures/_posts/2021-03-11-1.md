## Method
1. Find minimum key from the input sequence.
1. Delete it from input sequence.
1. Append it to resulting sequence.
1. Repeat until nothing is left in the original sequence.

### Example

| 34 | 10 | 64 | 51 | 32 | 21 | To Swap |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| <u>34</u> | **10** | 64 | 51 | 32 | 21 | 34, 10 |
| *10* | <u>34</u> | 64 | 51 | 32 | **21** | 34, 21 |
| *10* | *21* | <u>64</u> | 51 | **32** | 34 | 64, 32 |
| *10* | *21* | *32* | <u>51</u> | 64 | **34** | 51, 34 |
| *10* | *21* | *32* | *34* | <u>64</u> | **51** | 64, 51 |
| *10* | *21* | *32* | *34* | *51* | 64 |  |
| *10* | *21* | *32* | *34* | *51* | *64* |  |

<u>Underlined</u> is the current position, **bold** is the current smallest, and *italic* is sorted.

## Pseudo-Code
This will give the following code when using `while` loops:

```
i = 1
while i <= n do
begin
	loc = i
	j = i + 1
	while j <= n do
	begin
		if A[j] < A[loc] then
			loc = j
		j++
	end
	swap A[i] and A[loc]
	i++
end
```

and the following for `for` loops:

```
for i = 1 to (n - 1) do
begin
	loc = i
	for j = (i + 1) to n do
		if A[j] < A[loc] then
		loc = j
	swap A[i] and A[loc]
end
```

## Time Complexity
The nested for loops give the following table:

| $i$ | NÂ° of > Comparisons |
| :-- | :-- |
| $1$ | $n-1$ |
| $2$ | $n-2$ |
| $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |
| $n-1$ | $1$ |

This gives the following simplified equation:

$$\frac{n^2-n}{2}$$

We keep the highest power which gives the following big-O notation:

$$O(n^2)$$

## Using Linked Lists
### Pseudo-Code

```
if head ==  NIL then 
	Empty list and STOP
curr = head
while curr.next =/= NIL do
begin
	min = curr
	node = curr.next
	while node =/= NIL do
	begin
		if node.data < min dataq then
			min = node
		Node = node.next
	end 
	swapnode(curr,min)
	curr = curr.next
end
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is exactly the same as compared to using an array:

$$O(n^2)$$

## Cases

* In the **best** case selection sort takes 0 swaps.
* In the **worst** case, selection sort takes $O(n^2)$ times.
