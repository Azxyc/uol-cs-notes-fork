## Binary Search Tree
For a vertex with value $X$:

* Left child has value $\leq X$.
* Right child has value $> X$.

```mermaid
graph TD
60 --- 40
60 --- 90
40 --- 20
40 --- 50
20 --- 10
20 --- 30
90 --- 80
90 --- 110
80 --- 70
110 --- 100
110 --- 120
```

To search for a number go left if you want to go smaller and right if you want to go bigger.

In-order traversal gives the tree in ascending order.

## Expression Tree
This tree represents a mathematical expression.

For the following expression:

$$(2+5*4)\times3$$

In post-fix:

$$2\ 5\ 4 \times+\ 3\ \times$$

```mermaid
graph TD
*1[*] --- +
*1 --- 3((3))
+ --- 2((2))
+ --- *2[*]
*2 --- 5((5))
*2 --- 4((4))
```

Post-order traversal will give the post-fix representation.
