* **Paths**
	* A number of nodes from one point to another.
* **Circuits**
	* If the start and end of the path is the same then it is a circuit.
	
## Euler Circuits
A circuit that visits every **edge** once.

**Vertexes** can be repeated.
{:.info}

Not all graphs have an Euler circuit.
{:.warning}

### Conditions

* The graph must be **connected**.
	* This means that there must be no breaks in the graph.
* The degree of every vertex must be **even**.

## Hamiltonian Circuit
Oppositely to an Euler circuit, this is a circuit that contains every **vertex** once.

This may not visit all edges.

This is a difficult problem to solve and will be reviewed later.
