## Two Classic Results
These are classical proofs as they we're proven by the Ancient Greeks. They are both proofs by contradiction.

### Use proof by contradiction to show that there is no greatest prime number.
* 2, as the smallest prime number, is known as &#92;(P_1&#92;). All following prime numbers are numbered sequentially.
* For each prime number that is identified any multiples are removed from the endless list of integers.
	* This is continued for &#92;(P_2=3&#92;) where all multiples of 3 are removed.
	
How do we know that at some point in the list all numbers are eliminated?

#### Proof
Assume for a proof by contradiction that there is a greatest prime number &#92;(P_n&#92;).

Then &#92;(P_1, P_2, \ldots , P_n&#92;) are all prime numbers.

Consider &#92;(P=P_1\times P_2\times \ldots \times P_{n+1}&#92;)

Consider cases:

##### Case 1
&#92;(P=P_1\times P_2\times \ldots \times P_{n+1}&#92;) is prime. As &#92;(P>P_n&#92;) we derive a contradiction.

##### Case 2
&#92;(P&#92;) is not a prime. Then &#92;(P&#92;) has a divisor (all numbers can be expressed as a product of primes).

Then &#92;(P&#92;) has a prime factor.

So one of &#92;(P_1, P_2, \ldots , P_n&#92;) must divide &#92;(P&#92;). This number can be called &#92;(P_i&#92;). 

&#92;(P=P_i\times Q,\ Q\neq 1&#92;) 

&#92;(P_1\times\ldots P_{n+1}=P_i\times Q&#92;)

&#92;(P_1\times\ldots P_{i-1} \times P_i \times P_{i+1} \times\ldots P_{n+1}=P_i\times Q&#92;)

&#92;(P_i \times Q - P_i (P_1 \times\ldots\times P_{i-1} \times P_{i+1} \times P_n)=1&#92;)

&#92;(P_i(Q-P_1 \times\ldots\times P_{i-1} \times P_{i+1} \times\ldots\times P_n) = 1&#92;)

This is a contradiction as one is not a product of two distinct integers.

As a result the statement that there is no greatest prime number.

### Prove that &#92;(\sqrt{2}&#92;) is not a Rational Number
Assume for a proof by contradiction that &#92;(\sqrt{2}&#92;) is rational.

Then there exist integers &#92;(m,n&#92;) such that &#92;(\sqrt{2}=\frac{m}{n}, n\neq 0, \frac{m}{n}&#92;) is not reducible.

Then &#92;((\sqrt{2})^2=(\frac{m}{n})^2&#92;). Then &#92;(2=\frac{m^2}{n^2}&#92;).

Then &#92;(2n^2=m^2&#92;). So &#92;(m^2&#92;) is even.

We already know that &#92;(m&#92;) must be even. 

By definition of even &#92;(m=2k&#92;) for some integer &#92;(k&#92;). 

&#92;(2n^2=m^2, m=2k&#92;)

&#92;(2m^2=(2k)^2&#92;). Then &#92;(2n^2=4k^2&#92;). Then &#92;(n^2=2k^2&#92;), so &#92;(n^2&#92;) is even. 

Then &#92;(n&#92;) is even.

So we derive a contradiction as n and m have a common factor of &#92;(2&#92;). As it is reducible it doesn't follow the rule.

## Indirect Proof of Existential Statements
Prove that there exist irrational numbers &#92;(q&#92;) and &#92;(r&#92;) such that &#92;(q^r&#92;) is rational.

Consider Cases:

### Case 1
If &#92;(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}&#92;) is a rational number then we are done and &#92;(q=\sqrt2, r=\sqrt2&#92;).

### Case 2
&#92;(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}&#92;) is not rational. Then:

&#92;(q=\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}, r=\sqrt2&#92;)

&#92;(q^r = (\sqrt2^{\sqrt2})^{\sqrt2}=\sqrt2^{\sqrt2\sqrt2}=\sqrt2^2=2&#92;)
