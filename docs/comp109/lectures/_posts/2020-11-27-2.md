All the relations we have been looking at so far have been binary relations however this can be generalised for greater numbered relations.

## &#92;(n&#92;)-ary Relations
The Cartesian product &#92;(A_1\times A_2\times \ldots \times A_n&#92;) of sets &#92;(A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n&#92;) is defined by:

&#92;[
\begin{aligned}
A_1\times A_2\times \ldots \times A_n=&&#92;&#92;
&#92;{(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\ \vert\ a_1\in A_1,\ldots,a_n\in A_n&#92;}&
\end{aligned}
&#92;]

Here &#92;((a_1,\ldots,a_n)=(b_1,\ldots,b_n&#92;) if and only if &#92;(a_i=b_i&#92;) for all &#92;(1\leq i\leq n&#92;).

An &#92;(n&#92;)-ary relation is a subset of &#92;(A_1\times\ldots A_n&#92;)

### Databases and Relations
A database table &#92;(\approx&#92;) relation.

#### Table 1 &#92;(\text{Students}&#92;)

| Student_name | ID_number | Major | GPA |
| :-- | :-: | :-- | :-: |
| Ackermann | 231455 | Computer Science | 3.88 |
| Adams | 888323 | Physics | 3.45 |
| Chou | 102147 | Computer Science | 3.49 |
| Goodfriend | 453876 | Mathematics | 3.45 |
| Rao | 678543 | Mathematics | 3.9 |
| Stevens | 786576 | Psychology | 2.99 |

This student table is a subset of the Cartesian product of four sets containing names, ID numbers, subject and GPA. We can then write these properties in tuples in the subset: &#92;(\text{Students}=&#92;{\text{(Ackerman, 231455,}&#92;)&#92;(\text{ Computer Science, 3.88)}\ldots&#92;}&#92;).

## Unary Relations
Unary relation are just subsets of a set.

### Example
The unary relation &#92;(\text{EvenPositiveIntegers}&#92;) on the set &#92;(\Bbb{Z^+}&#92;) of positive integers is:

&#92;[&#92;{x\in\Bbb{Z^+}\ \vert\ x \text{ is even}&#92;}&#92;]

This shows that a unary relation is just a list of items in a set the satisfy a property.
