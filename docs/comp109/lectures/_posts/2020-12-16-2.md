## Sums and Products of a Sequence
Given a sequence of numbers:

&#92;[a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_m,\ldots,a_n&#92;]

we can use the notation:

* &#92;(\sum^n&#95;&#123;i=m}a_i&#92;) to represent &#92;(a_m+\ldots+a_n&#92;).
* &#92;(\prod^n&#95;&#123;i=m}a_i&#92;) to represent &#92;(a_m\times\ldots\times a_n&#92;).

Following from this you could combine indexes to make multiple iteration:

&#92;[\sum^5&#95;&#123;i=1}\sum^5&#95;&#123;j=i}(i+5)&#92;]

Here you would apply the sum using &#92;(j&#92;) for each sum using &#92;(i&#92;). The lower bound for the inner sum would increase every time to match the incrementing &#92;(i&#92;).

### Special Case &#92;(m=n&#92;)
&#92;[\sum^n&#95;&#123;i=m}=a_m&#92;]

Here you would just state the element at that index in the list. 

### Sums and Products Over Sets of Indices
Let &#92;(f:D\rightarrow\Bbb R&#92;) be a function with some domain &#92;(D&#92;). Then for &#92;(S\subseteq D&#92;):

* &#92;(\sum&#95;&#123;i\in S}f(i)&#92;) denotes the sum of &#92;(f(i)&#92;) over all &#92;(i\in S&#92;).

* &#92;(\prod&#95;&#123;i\in S}f(i)&#92;) denotes the product of &#92;(f(i)&#92;) over all &#92;(i\in S&#92;).

#### Example
Suppose that the domain &#92;(D=&#92;{a,b,c,d&#92;}&#92;). Additionally there is a function &#92;(f:D\rightarrow\Bbb R&#92;)

&#92;[
\begin{aligned}
f(a)&=0&f(b)&=1&#92;&#92;
f(c)&=0.3&f(d)&=-1
\end{aligned}
&#92;]

To find the sum of all the elements in &#92;(D&#92;) with the function applied to them would be:

&#92;[\sum&#95;&#123;i\in D}f(i)=0+1+.3-1=.3&#92;]

The same applies to products.

### The Factorial Function
The product &#92;(\prod^n&#95;&#123;i=1}i&#92;) comes up so often that is has a name. it is called &#92;(n&#92;) factorial and is written as &#92;(n!&#92;).

As &#92;(i=1&#92;) then &#92;(0!=1&#92;).

## Permutations
A permutation of a set is just an ordering of its elements.

By the product rule the number of permutations of an &#92;(n&#92;)-element set is &#92;(n!&#92;).

* This is because there are &#92;(n&#92;) choices for the first element, then &#92;(n-1&#92;) choices for the 2nd element, then &#92;(n-2&#92;) choices for the 3rd element and so on.
* Therefore the number of permutations of a list of 3 elements would be &#92;(3!=6&#92;)

### &#92;(k&#92;)-Permutations
A selection of &#92;(k&#92;) distinct elements of a set, where order matters is called a &#92;(k&#92;)-permutation of the set.

The number &#92;(k&#92;)-permutations of an &#92;(n&#92;)-element set is:

&#92;[
\begin{aligned}
P(n,k)&=n\times(n-1)\times\ldots\times(n-(k-1))&#92;&#92;
&=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
\end{aligned}
&#92;]

From the example last lecture, the number of combinations of three elements from a set of five elements where order matters is &#92;(P(5,3)=&#92;) &#92;(5\times4\times3&#92;).

#### Notable Example
I have a jar with 3 different sweet. Three children come in, and each take one. How many different outcomes are there?

&#92;[P(3,3)=3\times2\times1=\frac{3!}{0!}=6&#92;]

This is an example of why &#92;(0!&#92;) is 1.

Additionally, if the factorial is too large to calculate, you can cancel out values in the numerator and denominator to get a more manageable number.

### Counting &#92;(k&#92;)-Combinations
A size-&#92;(k&#92;) subset is called a &#92;(k&#92;)-combination.

The number of &#92;(k&#92;)-combinations of a set of size &#92;(n&#92;) is:

&#92;[C(n,k)=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}&#92;]

#### Proof 

1. The number of &#92;(k&#92;)-permutations of the set is &#92;(P(n,k)=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}&#92;).
1. A &#92;(k&#92;)-permutation is an ordering of &#92;(k&#92;) distinct elements of the set.
1. Each size-&#92;(k&#92;) subset has &#92;(k!&#92;) orderings, so it corresponds to &#92;(P(k,k)=k!&#92;) of the &#92;(k&#92;) permutations.
1. By the division rule, &#92;(C(n,k)=\frac{P(n,k)}{P(k,k)}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}&#92;).

This is to say that by dividing out the repeat values we are left with just distinct values.
