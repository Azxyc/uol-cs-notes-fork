## Combination Examples
The number of size 1 subsets of &#92;(&#92;{1,2,3,4,5&#92;}&#92;) is 5. This is also the number of size 4 subsets of the set. 

Any opposite subset sizes sample complements of each other and are therefore the same size.

Twelve people, including Mary and Peter, are candidates to serve on a committee of five. How many different committees are possible? 

There are:

&#92;[C(12,5)=\frac{12!}{(12-5)!5!}=792&#92;]

This is as a result of choosing combinations of 5 people form a set of 12 people.

### Of These How Many

1. Contain both Mary and Peter?
	&#92;[C(10,3)=120&#92;]
	In this case we disregard them and adjust the samples and sample size accordingly.
1. Contain neither Mary and Peter?
	&#92;[C(10,5)=252&#92;]
	In this case we select 5 members from the set without them.
1. Contain either Mary or Peter (but not both)?
	&#92;[2\times C(10,4)=420&#92;]
	
	This is because we have two possible cases for Mary and Peter which have combinations &#92;(C(10,4)=210&#92;).
