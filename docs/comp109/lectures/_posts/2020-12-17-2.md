## Binomial Coefficients
The quantity &#92;(C(n,k)&#92;), which gives the number of &#92;(k&#92;)-combinations of a set of size &#92;(n&#92;), is called a binomial coefficient.

It is also written as:

&#92;[{n\choose k}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}&#92;]

This notation is preferred.

### Binomial Theorem
For every natural number &#92;(n&#92;):

&#92;[(a+b)^n=\sum^n&#95;&#123;k=0}{n\choose k}a^kb^{n-k}&#92;]

This is the sum of a generic binomial expansion.

### Pascal's Triangle
The choose notation directly relates to pascals triangle. For a generic expansion the row is the power and the value is the coefficient of the related position in the expansion.

### Binomial Coefficient Identity

&#92;[{n+1\choose r+1}={n\choose r}+{n\choose r+1}&#92;]

Proof:

* &#92;({n+1\choose r+1}&#92;) is the number of ways to choose a subset of size &#92;(r+1&#92;) form a st of size &#92;(n+1&#92;).
* Suppose the set is &#92;(&#92;{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x&#95;&#123;n+1}&#92;}&#92;).
* How many subsets include &#92;(x&#95;&#123;x+1}&#92;)? We just choose a size-&#92;(r&#92;) subset from &#92;(&#92;{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x&#95;&#123;n+1}&#92;}&#92;), so there are &#92;(n\choose r+1&#92;) ways to do it.
* These outcomes are disjoint, so the total number of subsets is the sum of &#92;(n\choose r&#92;) and &#92;(n\choose r+1&#92;).

## Counting and Probabilities
Counting also helps us to answer questions like:

* What are the odds of winning the National Lottery?
* What payoffs should you expect?
* What is more likely in poker, full house or 4-of-a-kind?
