## Declarative Approach
The declarative approach to building agents includes telling the agent what it needs to know. From this the agent uses reasoning to deduce relevant consequences. It requires:

* A **knowledge base** / ontology
	* Which contains fact and general knowledge about a domain in some formal language.
* A **reasoning engine**
	* That produces relevant consequences of the knowledge base.
	
### Example

We want to know what day it is from the following crude knowledge base:

* If I have an AI lecture today, then it is Tuesday or Friday.
* It is not Tuesday.
* I have an AI lecture today or I have no class today.
* If I have no  class today, then I am sad.
* I am not sad.

From this knowledge base we can **infer** that the day is: Friday. 

A machine would use reasoning algorithms to solve particular problems in the knowledge base.

## Languages for KR&R
To store knowledge in a knowledge base and so reasoning. you have to represent the knowledge in a formal language that ca be processed by machines.

Rule-based languages and propositional logic are KR&R languages.
