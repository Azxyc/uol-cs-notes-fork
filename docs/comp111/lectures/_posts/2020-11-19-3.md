## First Form
If $P(A)>0$, then:

$$P(B\vert A)=\frac{P(A\vert B)\times P(B)}{P(A)}$$

### Proof
We have:

* $P(A\cap B)=P(A\vert B)\times P(B)$
* $P(A\cap B)=P(B\vert A)\times P(A)$

Thus:

$$P(A\vert B)\times P(B)=P(B\vert A)\times P(A)$$

By dividing by $P(A)$ we get:

$$P(B\vert A)=\frac{P(A\vert B)\times P(B)}{P(A)}$$

### Application - Diagnosis
Assume a patient walks into a doctor's office complaining of a stiff neck. The doctor knows:

* Meningitis may cause a patient to have a stiff neck 50% of the time.
	* Causal knowledge.
* The probability of having meningitis is $\frac{1}{50000}$
* The probability of having a stiff neck is $\frac{1}{20}$

What is the probability that the patient has meningitis?

Let $A$ be the event that the patient has a stiff neck and $B$ the event that they have meningitis:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(B\vert A)&=\frac{P(A\vert B)\times P(B)}{P(A)}=\\
\frac{\frac{1}{2}\times \frac{1}{50000}}{\frac{1}{20}}&=\frac{1}{5000}
\end{aligned}$$

* We can interpret the fact that the patient has a stiff neck as a new **observation**.
* Given this observation, we want to **classify** that patient as either having meningitis or not having meningitis.
* We have **prior** knowledge about the **unconditional** probability of having a stiff neck.
* We have **causal** knowledge about the number of times in which meningitis causes a stiff neck.
* We can then compute the diagnostic probabilities using: 

	$$P(B\vert A)=\frac{P(A\vert B)\times P(B)}{P(A)}$$
	
## Alternative Form
You may not have the prior probability for $A$ (the observation). In this case you can use other things that you might know in this alternative form.

If $P(A)>0$, then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&P(B\vert A)=\\
&\frac{P(A\vert B)\times P(B)}{P(A\vert B)\times P(B)+P(A\vert \neg B)\times P(\neg B)}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Proof
It suffices to show:

$$P(A)=P(A\vert B)\times P(B)+P(A\vert \neg B) \times P(\neg B)$$

But this follows from:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(A)&=P((A\cap B)\cup (A\cap \neg B))\\
&=P(A\cap B)+P(A\cap\neg B)\\
&=P(A\vert B)\times P(B)+P(A\vert \neg B)\times P(\neg B)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Application - Diagnosis
Assume a drug test is:

* Positive for users 99% of the time.
* Negative for non-users 99% of the time.

Assume that 0.5% take the drug.

What is the probability that a person whose test is positive (event $A$) takes the drug (event $B$)?

We have:

* $P(A\vert B)=\frac{99}{100}$
* $P(\neg A\vert \neg B)=\frac{99}{100}$
* $P(B)=\frac{1}{200}$

Thus:

* $P(A\vert \neg B) =\frac{1}{100}$
* $P(\neg B) =\frac{199}{200}$

Thus:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&P(B\vert A)=\\
&\frac{P(A\vert B)\times P(B)}{P(A\vert B)\times P(B)+P(A\vert \neg B)\times P(\neg B)}\\
&=\frac{99}{298}\approx0.33
\end{aligned}
$$

Due to the low value it means that it is hard to take an action based on the test. This is as a result of the low value of the people who take the drug. This results in many false positives for those that don't.
