Learning is the process of converting experience into expertise or knowledge.

For a machine the **input** to a learning algorithms is **training data** (representing experience) and the **output** is some expertise, which usually takes the form of another **computer program** that can perform some task.

## Types of Learning
### Supervised Learning
The learner is presented with examples:

$$(x_1,L(x_1)),\ldots,(x_n,L(x_n))\in \mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}$$

This is to say that it contains a list of pairs where the first element is data and the second is a provided label.

of labelled data $x_i$ $(L(x_i)$ is the label of $x_i$) and the task is to generalise the examples to a function $f:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}$. If $\mathcal{Y}$ is finite, then $f$ is also called a classifier.

### Unsupervised Learning
The learner aims to find structure (also called patterns) in data without using examples. Clustering data into similar ones is a typical unsupervised learning problem.

### Reinforcement Learning
Learning from rewards or punishments in a dynamic setting in which an agent has a long-term goal (winning a game, driving a car). Different from supervised learning as actions of the learner are not directly classified.

## Examples
### Hand-Written Digit Recognition
Say that you are given a set of handwritten numbers. There are a set of labelled images and the rest are unlabelled.

An input image of 28 by 28 pixels is given as a vector $\vec x=(x_1,\ldots,x_{28\times28}$ of real numbers. Learn a **classifier**:

$f:\\{\text{images}\\}\rightarrow\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$

### Face Detection
Learn a classifier:

$f:\\{\text{image windows}\\}\mapsto \\{\text{non-face, frontal face,}$ $\text{profile-face}\\}$

Again a supervised learning problem:

* Start with training data:
	* Image windows labelled with $\\{\text{non-face, frontal face, profile-face}\\}$.
	* Generalise the training data to classifier $f$.

### Spam Detection
Detect whether incoming email is pam or not.

A supervised learning problem: 

* Learn classifier:

	$$f:\{\text{emails}\}\rightarrow\{\text{spam, not-spam}\}$$

	from labelled input data (emails).
	
Input data is word-count (e.g. word viagra in email indicated spam.)

Requires a learning system as "enemy" keeps innovating.

## When do we Need Machine Learning?

* The problem's complexity.
* The need for adaptivity.

### Tasks that are too Complex to Program

* Tasks performed by animals/humans.
	* There are numerous tasks that we human beings perform routinely, yet our introspection concerning how we do them is not sufficiently elaborate to extract a well defined program.
	* Examples are given above.
	* Machine learning programs achieve quite satisfactory results.
* Tasks beyond human capabilities.
	* Another wide family of tasks that benefit from machine learning techniques are related to the analysis of very large and complex data sets.
	* Examples include: astronomical data, weather prediction, web search engines.
	* Meaningful information is buried in data archives that are way too large and too complex for humans to make sense of.
	
### Adaptivity

* One limiting feature of programmed tools is their rigidity. Once a program has been written down and installed, it stays unchanged. However many tasks change over time or from one user to another.
* Machine learning tools (programs whose behaviour adapts to their input data) offer a solution to such issues; they are, by nature, adaptive to changes in the environment they interact with.
* Examples include individual handwritten text, spam detection, speach recognition.
