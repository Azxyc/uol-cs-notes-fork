## What are Numbers?
Numbers are the objects that we use to count things. Depending on what we are counting we want to use different sets, or types, of numbers.

### Sets of Numbers

* $\Bbb N$:1,2,3,4... (Natural numbers)
	* Zero is not a part of this set.
* $\Bbb W$:0,1,2,3,4... (Whole numbers)
* $\Bbb Z$: ...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3... (Integers)
* $\Bbb Q$: $\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{4},\frac{2}{3},\frac{5}{8}$... (Rational)

$$\Bbb{N}\subseteq\Bbb{W}\subseteq\Bbb{Z}\subseteq\Bbb{Q}$$

All computers only use rational numbers.

### Irrational Numbers
If we want to calculate things such as areas and lengths then we cannot guarantee that we will receive a rational number.

This set of numbers are called the *Real Numbers* ($\Bbb{R}$)

These numbers are modelled by data types such as `float` and `double` in high level languages.
