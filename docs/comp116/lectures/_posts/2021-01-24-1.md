## What are Numbers?
Numbers are the objects that we use to count things. Depending on what we are counting we want to use different sets, or types, of numbers.

### Sets of Numbers

* &#92;(\Bbb N&#92;):1,2,3,4... (Natural numbers)
	* Zero is not a part of this set.
* &#92;(\Bbb W&#92;):0,1,2,3,4... (Whole numbers)
* &#92;(\Bbb Z&#92;): ...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3... (Integers)
* &#92;(\Bbb Q&#92;): &#92;(\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{4},\frac{2}{3},\frac{5}{8}&#92;)... (Rational)

&#92;[\Bbb{N}\subseteq\Bbb{W}\subseteq\Bbb{Z}\subseteq\Bbb{Q}&#92;]

All computers only use rational numbers.

### Irrational Numbers
If we want to calculate things such as areas and lengths then we cannot guarantee that we will receive a rational number.

This set of numbers are called the *Real Numbers* (&#92;(\Bbb{R}&#92;))

These numbers are modelled by data types such as `float` and `double` in high level languages.
