## $n$-vectors

* A set of numbers, $H$.

	* $H$ is one of: $\Bbb{N,W,Z,Q;R}$.
* A *natural* number, $n\in\Bbb{N}$.
* An $n$-vector over $H$, has $n$ components:
	$$\underline x = \langle x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\rangle$$
* Each $x_k\in H$.

This is *not a  set*: we cam have $x_s=x_t$ and $s\neq t$.

* The order of components matters: $\langle 1,2,1\rangle\neq\langle1,1,2\rangle$.

## Notation & Operands

In the presentation the lecturer will use the following notation:

* Arbitrary vectors: $\mathbf{\underline x,\underline y, \underline u, \underline v; \underline w}$.
* Writing vectors in full: $\langle u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_m\rangle$.
* For points we use: $(u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_m)$.

As this notation for arbitrary vectors is tedious to type the following will be used:

* Arbitrary vectors: $\vec x, \vec y,\vec u,\vec v, \vec w$.

### Operations

* Addition: $+$
* Scalar multiple: $*$
* Size or norm: $\Vert u\Vert$ or $\Vert u\Vert_2$
* Product: $\cdot$ or $\times$
	* You can use: $u\cdot v=\Vert u\Vert \Vert v\Vert cos\theta$.

Given $n$-vectors: $\vec u,\vec v,\vec w$ etc. and a constant $\alpha\in H$.

* Addition
	* $\vec w=\vec u+\vec v$
	* $w_k+v_k\forall k1\leq k\leq n$
		This is to say that if you want to add two vectors they need to have the same number of components.

* Scalar Multiple

	* $\vec w=\alpha\vec u$

	* $w_k=\alpha u_k\forall k1\leq k\leq n$

		This means that you just times all the components by the scalar.

* Norm

	* $\Vert u\Vert=\sqrt{\sum^n_{k=1}\vert u_k\vert^2}$

		This is just the Pythagorean theorem.

* Product 

	* Definition is not given.

## Attributes

*  A vector $\vec u$ has a size $\Vert u\Vert$ and a direction.
* A vector doesn't not have a position.
* The operation can be interpreted geometrically.

* The length of a vector resulting from adding two vectors may be written in terms of basic trigonometric relations.

## Dot Product

For two vectors, their dot product is the cosine of the angle between them. This gives the following cases:

* Right angles give a dot product of 0.
* Parallel vectors give a dot product of -1.
	* Position doesn't matter and thus the direction doesn't change this value.

## Special Vectors

* The zero vector $\vec 0$:
	* All values are zero.
* The basis vector $e_k$:
	* All components are zero except the $k^{th}$ which is equal to 1.
	* There are $n$ basis vectors, one for each $k$.

* Unit vectors:
	* Those whose magnitude is 1.
* Orthogonal vectors:
	* At right angles, whose dot product is 0.
