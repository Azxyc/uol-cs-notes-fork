Consider a function such as:

&#92;[z=-(3x^2+2y^2+xy)&#92;]

What are the values of &#92;(x&#92;) and &#92;(y&#92;) which maximise &#92;(z&#92;)?

Are there any such values?

## Partial Derivatives
For the prior function:

1. We need values of &#92;(x&#92;) and &#92;(y&#92;) which maximise &#92;(z&#92;).
1. We know &#92;(x&#92;) to maximise &#92;(z&#92;) when &#92;(y&#92;) is fixed.
1. We know &#92;(y&#92;) to maximise &#92;(z&#92;) when &#92;(x&#92;) is fixed.
1. But we want to do things simultaneously.
1. Assume that &#92;(y&#92;) is fixed and find the "right" &#92;(x&#92;).
1. Assume that &#92;(x&#92;) is fixed and find the "right" &#92;(y&#92;).

From this we can make a set of simultaneous equations to solve.

### Example

For &#92;(z=-(3x^2+2y^2+xy)&#92;).

1. Differentiate as if &#92;(y&#92;) was a constant:
	
	&#92;[f_x(x,y)=-(6x+y)&#92;]
	
1. Differentiate &#92;(f(x,y)&#92;) as if &#92;(x&#92;) was a constant.

	&#92;[f_y(x,y)=-(4y+x)&#92;]
	
1. Find the values of &#92;(x,y&#92;) for which &#92;(f_x(x,y)=0,&#92;)  &#92;(f_y(x,y)=0&#92;) by solving the simultaneous equations.

## Notation
For functions of two variables (&#92;(z=f(x,y)&#92;)) we have:

* &#92;(f_x(x,y)&#92;) - The first partial derivative of &#92;(f(x,y)&#92;) with respect to &#92;(x&#92;).
* &#92;(f_y(x,y)&#92;) - The first partial derivative of &#92;(f(x,y)&#92;) with respect to &#92;(y&#92;).

Also used are:

&#92;[\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}; \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}&#92;]

For a function of &#92;(n&#92;) variables:

&#92;[z = f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k,\ldots,x_n)&#92;]

this style of notation will be used:

&#92;[\frac{\partial z}{\partial x_k}&#92;]

## Example Continued
From the prior example the two simultaneous equations were:

&#92;[
\begin{aligned}
-6x-y&=0&#92;&#92;
-x-4y&=0
\end{aligned}
&#92;]

The only solution is: &#92;(x=0, y=0&#92;).

Therefore, this function is **critical** at the point &#92;((0,0)&#92;).

To test if this is maximum we need an analogue of the **second derivative** test.

## Second Derivative Test with 2 Variables

1. With **2 variables** there are **4 possible** forms of the second order partial derivative.
1. With &#92;(n&#92;) variables there are &#92;(n^2&#92;).

How do we combine these? 

The 4 forms: &#92;((f&#95;&#123;xx},f&#95;&#123;xy},f&#95;&#123;yx},f&#95;&#123;yy})&#92;) or:

&#92;[\frac{\partial^2z}{\partial x^2},\frac{\partial^2z}{\partial x\partial y},\frac{\partial^2z}{\partial y\partial x},\frac{\partial^2z}{\partial y^2}&#92;]

### Interpretation of Notation
* &#92;(f&#95;&#123;xx}&#92;) - The partial derivative of &#92;(f_x&#92;) with respect to &#92;(x&#92;).
* &#92;(f&#95;&#123;xy}&#92;) - The partial derivative of &#92;(f_y&#92;) with respect to &#92;(x&#92;).

For &#92;(f(x,y)=-(3x^2+2y^2+xy)&#92;):

&#92;[
\begin{aligned}
f&#95;&#123;xx}&=-6&#92;&#92;
f&#95;&#123;xy}&=-1&#92;&#92;
f&#95;&#123;yx}&=-1&#92;&#92;
f&#95;&#123;yy}&=-4
\end{aligned}
&#92;]

In general &#92;(f&#95;&#123;xy}&#92;) and &#92;(f&#95;&#123;yx}&#92;) are **identical functions**.

### Using the Test
There is a **precondition**:

&#92;[(f&#95;&#123;xx}f&#95;&#123;yy}-(f&#95;&#123;xy})^2)(\alpha, \beta)>0&#92;]

* If &#92;(f&#95;&#123;xx}(\alpha, \beta)>0&#92;) the point is a **minimum**.
* If &#92;(f&#95;&#123;xx}(\alpha, \beta)<0&#92;) the point is a **maximum**.
* If &#92;(f&#95;&#123;xx}(\alpha, \beta)=0&#92;) no conclusion can be made.

Where &#92;((\alpha, \beta)&#92;) is the critical point.
