Complex numbers revolve around the imaginary number &#92;(i&#92;). It follows the following identities:

&#92;[
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{-1}&=i&#92;&#92;
i^2&=-1&#92;&#92;
(-i)^2&=(-1)^2\times i^2&#92;&#92;&=-1
\end{aligned}
&#92;]

In general, complex numbers are written in the form:

&#92;[z=a+ib&#92;]

* &#92;(a&#92;) is called the real part of &#92;(z&#92;):
	* &#92;(\text{Re}(z)&#92;)
* &#92;(b&#92;) is called the imaginary part of &#92;(z&#92;):
	* * &#92;(\text{Im}(z)&#92;)
* The numbers &#92;(a+ib&#92;)  (&#92;(a&#92;) and &#92;(b&#92;) are both real numbers) form the set of complex numbers: denoted by &#92;(C&#92;).

The pars of real numbers &#92;((\text{Re}(z),\text{Im}(z))\ z\in C&#92;) form the complex plane.

## Basic Operations
### Addition &#92;(z=u+v&#92;)
For addition of complex numbers you add the corresponding components together.
### Complex Conjugate &#92;(\bar z&#92;)
The real part stays the same but the imaginary part is multiplied by &#92;(-1&#92;).

&#92;[\overline{1+i}=1-i&#92;]
### Modulus &#92;(\vert z\vert&#92;)

&#92;[\vert z \vert =\sqrt{\text{Re}(z)^2+\text{Im}(z)^2}&#92;]

We take the positive root.

## Complex Operations
### Scalar Multiplication &#92;(z=\alpha \times u&#92;)
This is as you would expect.

### Complex Multiplication &#92;(z=u\times v&#92;)
You would expand the two like multiplying brackets.
### Division &#92;(z=u\div v&#92;)
In order to divide we need to emulate &#92;(v^{-1}&#92;) in complex numbers. This is defined as so:

&#92;[
\frac{1}{v}=\frac{\bar v}{\vert v\vert^2}
&#92;]

Additionally &#92;(v\neq 0&#92;)

We can check this by multiplying &#92;(v&#92;) with &#92;(v^{-1}&#92;) to get &#92;(1&#92;).
