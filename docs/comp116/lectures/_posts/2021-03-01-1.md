Complex numbers revolve around the imaginary number $i$. It follows the following identities:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{-1}&=i\\
i^2&=-1\\
(-i)^2&=(-1)^2\times i^2\\&=-1
\end{aligned}
$$

In general, complex numbers are written in the form:

$$z=a+ib$$

* $a$ is called the real part of $z$:
	* $\text{Re}(z)$
* $b$ is called the imaginary part of $z$:
	* * $\text{Im}(z)$
* The numbers $a+ib$  ($a$ and $b$ are both real numbers) form the set of complex numbers: denoted by $C$.

The pars of real numbers $(\text{Re}(z),\text{Im}(z))\ z\in C$ form the complex plane.

## Basic Operations
### Addition $z=u+v$
For addition of complex numbers you add the corresponding components together.
### Complex Conjugate $\bar z$
The real part stays the same but the imaginary part is multiplied by $-1$.

$$\overline{1+i}=1-i$$
### Modulus $\vert z\vert$

$$\vert z \vert =\sqrt{\text{Re}(z)^2+\text{Im}(z)^2}$$

We take the positive root.

## Complex Operations
### Scalar Multiplication $z=\alpha \times u$
This is as you would expect.

### Complex Multiplication $z=u\times v$
You would expand the two like multiplying brackets.
### Division $z=u\div v$
In order to divide we need to emulate $v^{-1}$ in complex numbers. This is defined as so:

$$
\frac{1}{v}=\frac{\bar v}{\vert v\vert^2}
$$

Additionally $v\neq 0$

We can check this by multiplying $v$ with $v^{-1}$ to get $1$.
