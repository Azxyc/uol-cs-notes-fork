## Complex numbers as &#92;(2\times 2&#92;) Matrices
For the complex number &#92;(z=a+ib&#92;):

&#92;[\mathbf M_z=\begin{pmatrix}a & -b &#92;&#92; b & a\end{pmatrix}&#92;]

The following operations will then apply:

* Addition and Multiplication
	* As normal.
* Conjugate
	* &#92;(\mathbf M&#95;&#123;\bar z}=\mathbf M_z^\top&#92;)	- This is the transpose of &#92;(\mathbf M_z&#92;).
* Modulus
	* &#92;(\vert z\vert=\text{det }\mathbf M_z&#92;)
	
## Argand Diagram
In this representation then you treat them as vectors.

* Conjugate is reflection in the real axis.
* The modulus is the size of the vector.

Multiplication and division don't have a natural geometric analogy.

## Polar Coordinates
For &#92;(z=a_ib&#92;) with &#92;(\vert z\vert=r&#92;). The number &#92;(z&#92;) is described in polar form as:

&#92;[z=(r,\theta)&#92;]

The angle (phase) of the complex number is denoted as &#92;(\text{arg}\ z&#92;). It can be shown as:

&#92;[
\begin{aligned}
\text{arg}\ z &= \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{Re}(z)}{\vert z\vert}\right)&#92;&#92;
&= \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{Im}(z)}{\vert z\vert}\right)
\end{aligned}
&#92;]

## Euler Form
For &#92;(z=a_ib&#92;) with &#92;(\vert z\vert=r&#92;) and &#92;(\text{arg}\ z=\theta&#92;). The number &#92;(z&#92;) is described in Euler form as:

&#92;[z=r\times e^{i\theta}&#92;]

This gives the following identity:

&#92;[z=re^{i\theta}=r(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)&#92;]

This relation is known as **Euler's Formula** and leads to (&#92;(\forall\alpha\in\Bbb R&#92;)):

&#92;[(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)^\alpha=\cos(\alpha\theta)+i\sin(\alpha\theta)&#92;]

### Consequences of Euler Form
For &#92;(\vert u \vert = s&#92;) and &#92;(\text{arg} u=\sigma&#92;), &#92;(\vert v\vert=t&#92;) and &#92;(\text{arg}v=\tau&#92;):

&#92;[uv = se^{i\sigma}te^{i\tau}=(st)e^{i(\sigma+\tau)}&#92;]

Looking at Argand diagram: the **phase** resulting from the **product** of two complex numbers is the result of **adding** the **phase of each**.

There are **infinitely many** representations of any single complex number. To avoid this we use the principle value of &#92;(\theta&#92;).

Principle values can be written as &#92;(\varphi_m&#92;).

## Primitive Roots of Unity
For any &#92;(k\in\Bbb N&#92;) there are exactly &#92;(k&#92;) **primitive roots of unity**.

### Example
Identify a primitive **fourth** root of unity **modulo 8**.

For each value:

&#92;[p\in&#92;{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#92;}&#92;]

Compute &#92;(p^4(\mod 8)&#92;):

&#92;[&#92;{0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1&#92;}&#92;]

If it divides wholely then we don't count it.

The four primitive roots are:

&#92;[&#92;{1,3,5,7&#92;}&#92;]
