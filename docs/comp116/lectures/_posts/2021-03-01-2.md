## Complex numbers as $2\times 2$ Matrices
For the complex number $z=a+ib$:

$$\mathbf M_z=\begin{pmatrix}a & -b \\ b & a\end{pmatrix}$$

The following operations will then apply:

* Addition and Multiplication
	* As normal.
* Conjugate
	* $\mathbf M_{\bar z}=\mathbf M_z^\top$	- This is the transpose of $\mathbf M_z$.
* Modulus
	* $\vert z\vert=\text{det }\mathbf M_z$
	
## Argand Diagram
In this representation then you treat them as vectors.

* Conjugate is reflection in the real axis.
* The modulus is the size of the vector.

Multiplication and division don't have a natural geometric analogy.

## Polar Coordinates
For $z=a_ib$ with $\vert z\vert=r$. The number $z$ is described in polar form as:

$$z=(r,\theta)$$

The angle (phase) of the complex number is denoted as $\text{arg}\ z$. It can be shown as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{arg}\ z &= \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{Re}(z)}{\vert z\vert}\right)\\
&= \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{Im}(z)}{\vert z\vert}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Euler Form
For $z=a_ib$ with $\vert z\vert=r$ and $\text{arg}\ z=\theta$. The number $z$ is described in Euler form as:

$$z=r\times e^{i\theta}$$

This gives the following identity:

$$z=re^{i\theta}=r(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)$$

This relation is known as **Euler's Formula** and leads to ($\forall\alpha\in\Bbb R$):

$$(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)^\alpha=\cos(\alpha\theta)+i\sin(\alpha\theta)$$

### Consequences of Euler Form
For $\vert u \vert = s$ and $\text{arg} u=\sigma$, $\vert v\vert=t$ and $\text{arg}v=\tau$:

$$uv = se^{i\sigma}te^{i\tau}=(st)e^{i(\sigma+\tau)}$$

Looking at Argand diagram: the **phase** resulting from the **product** of two complex numbers is the result of **adding** the **phase of each**.

There are **infinitely many** representations of any single complex number. To avoid this we use the principle value of $\theta$.

Principle values can be written as $\varphi_m$.

## Primitive Roots of Unity
For any $k\in\Bbb N$ there are exactly $k$ **primitive roots of unity**.

### Example
Identify a primitive **fourth** root of unity **modulo 8**.

For each value:

$$p\in\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$$

Compute $p^4(\mod 8)$:

$$\{0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1\}$$

If it divides wholely then we don't count it.

The four primitive roots are:

$$\{1,3,5,7\}$$
