## Iterated Function Sequences
Let &#92;(f:\Bbb C\rightarrow \Bbb C&#92;) be some complex valued function.

The &#92;(n^{\text{th}}&#92;) iterate of &#92;(f&#92;), denoted by &#92;(f_(n)&#92;), when applied to &#92;(z\in\Bbb C&#92;) is the complex number, denoted by &#92;(z_n&#92;), that results by applying &#92;(f&#92;) repeatedly (to the initial value &#92;(z_0&#92;)). Thus:

&#92;[
f&#95;&#123;(n)}(z)=\begin{cases}z & \text{if }n=0&#92;&#92;f\left(f&#95;&#123;n-1}(z)\right)&\text{if }n>0\end{cases}
&#92;]

### Escape Radius
The complex plane ca be divided into **two disjoint parts** relative to some parameter &#92;(r&#92;) called the **escape radius** of &#92;(f&#92;):

&#92;[
\begin{aligned}
\text{in}(f)&=&#92;{z\in\Bbb C:\forall n\vert f&#95;&#123;(n)}(z)\vert\leq r&#92;}&#92;&#92;
\text{out}(f)&=&#92;{z\in\Bbb C:\exists k\vert f&#95;&#123;(f)}(z)\vert>r&#92;}
\end{aligned}
&#92;]

The escape radius can often be set as &#92;(r=2&#92;).

### Orbits
An orbit is a sequence that loops back on itself:

&#92;[f(z_k)=z_0;f(z_j)=z&#95;&#123;j+1}\forall 0\leq j<k&#92;]

### Popular Sets
Interesting patters are generally of the form:

&#92;[f(z)=z^2+c;c\in\Bbb C&#92;]

The **Mandelbrot Set** classifies those &#92;(c&#92;) for which:

&#92;[\vert f&#95;&#123;(n)}(0)\vert\leq 2;\forall n\geq0&#92;]

If &#92;(c&#92;) is fixed the subset (using radius 2) &#92;(\text{in}(z^2+c)&#92;) is called a **Julia Set** while the set &#92;(\text{out}(z^2+c)&#92;) is called the **Fatou Set**.


#### Computing and Displaying Sets
Iterating a fixed number of times gives a good enough approximation.

The colour mapping of these sets often represent the number of times required to iterate before a point exceeds the escape radius.

#### Fractal Dimension
In Euclidean dimension, the dimension is based on whole numbers. Fractal sets have a dimension that is in the rationals (&#92;(\Bbb Q&#92;)).
