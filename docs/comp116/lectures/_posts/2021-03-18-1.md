This is the method that we use to draw trends from experimental data. This is better than a table as it makes the data clearer.

## Example
How to we best fit a line to this graph:

| &#92;(x&#92;) | 1.5 | 2.4 | 3.6 | 4.2 | 4.8 | 5.7 | 6.3 | 7.9 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| &#92;(y&#92;) | 1.2 | 1.5 | 1.9 | 2.0 | 2.2 | 2.4 | 2.5 | 2.8 |

It seems that a curve would be best suited.

## Least Squares
The standard interpretation of best fit is **least squares**.

We have data observation pairs:

&#92;[&#92;{\langle x_k,y_k\rangle:1\leq k\leq n&#92;}&#92;]

We want a function &#92;(F:\Bbb R\rightarrow \Bbb R&#92;) that best describes these (minimises):

&#92;[\sum^n&#95;&#123;k=1}(y_k-F(x_k))^2&#92;]

This gives smaller values if the function fits the data better.

## Linear Functions & Regression
This function is in the following form:

&#92;[F(x)=ax+b&#92;]

This means that finding the best line is finding the combination of &#92;(a&#92;) and &#92;(b&#92;) which results in the least squares sum.

### Applying Least Squares
To minimise we would use the following function:

&#92;[F(a,b)=\sum^n&#95;&#123;k=1}(y_k-ax_k-b)^2&#92;]

Notice that the values &#92;(&#92;{\langle x_k,y_k\rangle:1\leq k\leq n&#92;}&#92;) are constants.

To solve this we use partial differentiation, finding &#92;(\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial a},\frac{\partial F}{\partial b}\right)&#92;), and find the critical points for these.

### Best Line Fit Function
From that we find that the best line fit function is:

&#92;[\left(\frac{nW&#95;&#123;xy}-W_xW_y}{nW&#95;&#123;xx}-(W_x)^2}\right)x+\left(\frac{W&#95;&#123;xx}W_y-W&#95;&#123;xy}W_x}{nW&#95;&#123;xx}-(W_x)^2}\right)&#92;]

Where:

&#92;[
\begin{aligned}
W_x&=\sum^n&#95;&#123;k=1}x_k&#92;&#92;
W_y&=\sum^n&#95;&#123;k=1}y_k&#92;&#92;
W&#95;&#123;xx}&=\sum^n&#95;&#123;k=1}x_k^2&#92;&#92;
W_xy&=\sum^n&#95;&#123;k=1}x_ky_k&#92;&#92;
\end{aligned}
&#92;]

## Other Functions
Other functions can have the following forms:

* Powers - &#92;(ax^b&#92;)
* Exponentials - &#92;(ae^{bx}&#92;)
	* Also can be written as &#92;(a\exp(bx)&#92;).
* Logarithms - &#92;(a\ln x+b&#92;)
* Linear Rational Functions - &#92;(\frac1{ax+b}&#92;)

We may also have more than one parameter to optimise:

* Quadratic Functions - &#92;(ax^2+bx+c&#92;)

## Data Analysis Issues
The functions shown so far require manual selection and thus don't always exactly match the pairs of data that have been observed.

* **Lagrange interpolation** finds the best polynomial to fit a set of data.
* **Trigonometric interpolation** finds the best trigonometric curve to fit a set of data.
	* This is useful in signal processing.
