This is the method that we use to draw trends from experimental data. This is better than a table as it makes the data clearer.

## Example
How to we best fit a line to this graph:

| $x$ | 1.5 | 2.4 | 3.6 | 4.2 | 4.8 | 5.7 | 6.3 | 7.9 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| $y$ | 1.2 | 1.5 | 1.9 | 2.0 | 2.2 | 2.4 | 2.5 | 2.8 |

It seems that a curve would be best suited.

## Least Squares
The standard interpretation of best fit is **least squares**.

We have data observation pairs:

$$\{\langle x_k,y_k\rangle:1\leq k\leq n\}$$

We want a function $F:\Bbb R\rightarrow \Bbb R$ that best describes these (minimises):

$$\sum^n_{k=1}(y_k-F(x_k))^2$$

This gives smaller values if the function fits the data better.

## Linear Functions & Regression
This function is in the following form:

$$F(x)=ax+b$$

This means that finding the best line is finding the combination of $a$ and $b$ which results in the least squares sum.

### Applying Least Squares
To minimise we would use the following function:

$$F(a,b)=\sum^n_{k=1}(y_k-ax_k-b)^2$$

Notice that the values $\\{\langle x_k,y_k\rangle:1\leq k\leq n\\}$ are constants.

To solve this we use partial differentiation, finding $\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial a},\frac{\partial F}{\partial b}\right)$, and find the critical points for these.

### Best Line Fit Function
From that we find that the best line fit function is:

$$\left(\frac{nW_{xy}-W_xW_y}{nW_{xx}-(W_x)^2}\right)x+\left(\frac{W_{xx}W_y-W_{xy}W_x}{nW_{xx}-(W_x)^2}\right)$$

Where:

$$
\begin{aligned}
W_x&=\sum^n_{k=1}x_k\\
W_y&=\sum^n_{k=1}y_k\\
W_{xx}&=\sum^n_{k=1}x_k^2\\
W_xy&=\sum^n_{k=1}x_ky_k\\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Other Functions
Other functions can have the following forms:

* Powers - $ax^b$
* Exponentials - $ae^{bx}$
	* Also can be written as $a\exp(bx)$.
* Logarithms - $a\ln x+b$
* Linear Rational Functions - $\frac1{ax+b}$

We may also have more than one parameter to optimise:

* Quadratic Functions - $ax^2+bx+c$

## Data Analysis Issues
The functions shown so far require manual selection and thus don't always exactly match the pairs of data that have been observed.

* **Lagrange interpolation** finds the best polynomial to fit a set of data.
* **Trigonometric interpolation** finds the best trigonometric curve to fit a set of data.
	* This is useful in signal processing.
