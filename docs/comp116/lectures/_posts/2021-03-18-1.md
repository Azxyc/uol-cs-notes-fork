This is the method that we use to draw trends from experimental data. This is better than a table as it makes the data clearer.

## Example
How to we best fit a line to this graph:

```chart
type: 'scatter',
data: {
	datasets: [{
		label: 'Scatter Dataset',
		data: [
			{x: 1.5,
			y: 1.2},
			{x: 2.4,
			y: 1.5},
			{x: 3.6,
			y: 1.9},
			{x: 4.2,
			y: 2.0},
			{x: 4.8,
			y: 2.2},
			{x: 5.7,
			y: 2.4},
			{x: 6.3,
			y: 2.5},
			{x: 7.9,
			y: 2.8
        }]
    }]
},
options: {
    scales: {
        xAxes: [{
            type: 'linear',
            position: 'bottom'
        }]
    }
}
```

It seems that a curve would be best suited.

## Least Squares
The standard interpretation of best fit is **least squares**.

We have data observation pairs:

&#92;[&#92;{\langle x_k,y_k\rangle:1\leq k\leq n&#92;}&#92;]

We want a function &#92;(F:\Bbb R\rightarrow \Bbb R&#92;) that best describes these (minimises):

&#92;[\sum^n&#95;&#123;k=1}(y_k-F(x_k))^2&#92;]

This gives smaller values if the function fits the data better.

## Linear Functions & Regression
This function can be found very easily.
