Spectral methods refer to the study of matrices.

## Identity Matrix
The identity matrix $I$ is a matrix which is all zero apart from the lead diagonal:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

For any matrix $A$:

$$A\times I = I \times A = A$$

This is valid for square matrices.

## Matrix Inverse
For an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ its inverse is the matrix denoted by $A^{-1}$ for which:

$$A\times A^{-1}=A^{-1}\times A=I$$

Not every matrix has an inverse.
