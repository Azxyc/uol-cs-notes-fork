## Vectors
### Movement
3D vectors are ordered like so:

&#92;[\langle x,y,z\rangle&#92;]

With &#92;(z&#92;) being the **vertical** component.

In 4D a 4&#92;(^{th}&#92;) dimension is used for **time**:

&#92;[\langle x,y,z,t\rangle&#92;]

### Size
Here is an example:

&#92;[\vert\vert\langle1,-2,2,-4\rangle\vert\vert&#92;]

You will generally be expected to find the **euclidean distance**.

This example will give:

&#92;[\sqrt{25}=5&#92;]

### Spaces
Suppose you are given the following collection:

&#92;[S=&#92;{\langle p,q,r\rangle\in\Bbb Z ^3_8:p^q=q^r&#92;}&#92;]

Three vectors from the set of integers with modulo 8. When we take the first component and raise it to the power of the second modulo 8 we get the same as the second and third

&#92;[H=\Bbb Z_8=&#92;{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7&#92;}&#92;]

1. &#92;(S&#92;) is closed under scalar multiplication - False
1. &#92;(S&#92;) is not closed under addition. - True
1. &#92;(S&#92;) contains &#92;(\langle0,1,1\rangle&#92;). - False
1. &#92;(S&#92;) is a vector space. - False
1. &#92;(S&#92;) does not contain &#92;(\langle1,1,0\rangle&#92;). - False

## Matrices
You can't implement translation using a &#92;(2\times2&#92;) vector. Scaling and rotation you can.
