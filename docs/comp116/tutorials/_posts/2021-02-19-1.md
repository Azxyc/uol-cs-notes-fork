## Vectors
### Movement
3D vectors are ordered like so:

$$\langle x,y,z\rangle$$

With $z$ being the **vertical** component.

In 4D a 4$^{th}$ dimension is used for **time**:

$$\langle x,y,z,t\rangle$$

### Size
Here is an example:

$$\vert\vert\langle1,-2,2,-4\rangle\vert\vert$$

You will generally be expected to find the **euclidean distance**.

This example will give:

$$\sqrt{25}=5$$

### Spaces
Suppose you are given the following collection:

$$S=\{\langle p,q,r\rangle\in\Bbb Z ^3_8:p^q=q^r\}$$

Three vectors from the set of integers with modulo 8. When we take the first component and raise it to the power of the second modulo 8 we get the same as the second and third

$$H=\Bbb Z_8=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$$

1. $S$ is closed under scalar multiplication - False
1. $S$ is not closed under addition. - True
1. $S$ contains $\langle0,1,1\rangle$. - False
1. $S$ is a vector space. - False
1. $S$ does not contain $\langle1,1,0\rangle$. - False

## Matrices
You can't implement translation using a $2\times2$ vector. Scaling and rotation you can.
