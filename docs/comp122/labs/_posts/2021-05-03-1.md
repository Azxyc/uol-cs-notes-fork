Refer to the [installation notes](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html) for full install details. In summary, install the `gradle` package:

```
$ yay -S gradle
```

## Setting up a Java Gradle Project
This will be following the [documentation](https://guides.gradle.org/building-java-applications/) for setting up a new java project.

1. Create a new project directory:
	
	```
	$ mkdir demo
	$ cd demo
	```
1. Make a new gradle project using the step-by-step wizard.

	```
	$ gradle init
	```
	
	* For project type choose application (2).
	* As implementation language chose Java (3).
	* As test framework select “JUnit Jupiter” (4).
	* For the other questions just select the default value.
1. Several files and a folder hierarchy are created. This includes a simple "Hello World" program.
1. To test, build and run your code execute in the root of the project:
	
	```
	$ ./gradlew run
	```
	
	The program is run after the output:
	
	```
	> Task :run
	```

## Gradle Tasks
Gradle has has several tasks:

* To clean the project directory:
	
	```
	$ ./gradlew clean
	```
	
	This will remove all compiler class files.
* To compile but not run your project:
	
	```
	$ ./gradlew compileJava
	```
	
	This will compiler all java source files in `app/src/main/java` and output the compiler bytecode into `app/build/main`.
	
To view additional help run:

```
$ ./gradlew help
```
