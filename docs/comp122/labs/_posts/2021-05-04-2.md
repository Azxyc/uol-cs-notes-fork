## Local Setup
The bare minimum of setup is to set the `user.name` and `user.email`:

```
$ git config --global user.name "Ben Weston"
$ git config --global user.email sgbweso@liverpool.ac.uk
```

## Creating a Repository
To initialise a new repository you can do the following inside a new folder:

```
$ git init
```

To check the status of the repo use:

```
$ git status
```

## Adding Files
To stage a new file that you have made, run the following:

```
$ git add newFile.txt
```

To commit this file to the database you can use the following:

```
$ git commit -m "Adding the newest file ever."
```

To use a text editor to draft the commit message, ommit the `-m` flag.
{:.info}

You can see your history of coimmits by using:

```
$ git log
```

## Changing and Reverting Files
To add the changes for all modified (but not new) files:

```
$ git commit -a -m "Adding changes."
```

To remove to the previous commit of a file:

```
$ git checkout file.txt
```

To pick a particular commit view the commit history and run the following:

```
$ git log
$ git checkout <commit identifier> file.txt
```

You can also just use the identifier prefix.
