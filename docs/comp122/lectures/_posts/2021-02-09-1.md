Java is an interpreted language that compiles into bytecode in order to make optimisations. To run a java program you would complete the following steps:

1. Compile a source code file `Hello.java` with `javac Hello.java`. This will create a bytecode file `Hello.class`.
1. Start the JVM and run `Hello.class` with `java Hello`.
