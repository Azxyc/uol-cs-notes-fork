Arrays are variable storing **fixed-length** lists of values with the **same type**.

For example we can have an integer array called `count` and type `int[]`.

## Array Types
For every type `x` there is a corresponding array type `x[]`.

## Declaring Array Variables

```java
int[] numbers;
double[] reals;
boolean[] truthValues;
```

## Creating Arrays
In order to use an array variable, the compiler needs to know the length of the array to allocate the appropriate chunk of memory. 

There is a special statement that creates a new array:

```java
double[] rates = new double[200];
boolean[] truthValues = new boolean[18];

// Length defined by another variable
int alphabetSize = 26;
int[] count = new int[alphabetSize];
```

## Remarks on Arrays

* Every array has a `length` attribute which tells you its size:

	```java
	int sizeOfAlphabet = count.length;
	```
* Array elements are accessed by index using square brackets:
	
	```java
	numberOfAs = count[0];
	numberOfCs = count[2];
	```

## Multi-dimensional Arrays
Every  type `x` has an associated type `x[]`. This includes arrays. For example we can represent a chess board as 2D integer arrays.

```java
int[][] board = new int [8][8];
```

You can also define arrays literally:

```java
int[][] board = {
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	...
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}
}
```
