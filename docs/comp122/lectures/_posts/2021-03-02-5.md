## Instance Variables
Ordinarily, *attribute values* belong to *individual objects* and *methods* describe the object's individual *response to messages*.

An example is that two alarm clocks can each have their  own type.

## Class Variables
Using the keyword `static` you can declare that an attribute (or method) **belongs to the class**. This means that it is shared among all instances.

An example would be that all alarm clock from your manufacturer have the same `make`.

## Static Variables & Methods
* The values of `static` variables can be read and modified  by all instances of the class, as well as from within `static` methods.
	
	Changing the `make` of one clock will affect all other clocks.

* `static` methods cannot access instance variables or instance methods but only other `static` members.
	
	One clock cannot directly find out the time of another clock without a service.

* `static` methods can be called directly on the class without instantiating an object. E.g. `AlarmClock.ring();`.

	`static` and `public` methods can be called without making an object.
