Using `for` loops on lists can be dangerous as their size is not static.

We can separate the traversal logic from the underlying collection by using iterators.

## Iterator Design Pattern
Iterators provide a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underling representation.

* Iterators are objects.
* Single-use
	* Represents one complete iteration across the collection.
* Can provide safe access to a collection.
* Are often created by the collection itself.

## Example
We can filer a `List<Bill>` using an `Iterator` as follows:

```java
// get an iterator from the collection
Iterator<Bill> iter = bills.iterator();

while (iter.hasNext()){
	Bill b = iter.next();	// access next entry
	if (b.is_paid()){
		iter.remove();	// remove it from the list
	}
}
```

## Java Iterators

* `Iterator<T>` is a parameterised interface. You must specify the type of object stored in the collection.
* `Iterators` provide a safe `remove()` method that removes the last element returned by its `next()` method.
* This is different from the `remove()` method of the collection.

## Alternative `for` Syntax
If you don't need to write to the collection, so don't need the iterator, then you can use the following syntax:

```java
for (Bill b : bills){
	// System.out.println(b);
}
```

which is equivalent to:

```java
Iterator<Bill> iter=bills.iterator();
while (iter.hasNext()){
	Bill b = iter.next();
	// System.out.println(b);
}
```
