When something unexpected happens:

1. An `Exception` object is created.
1. The interpreted looks for, and calls a matching handler.

## Java Syntax

```java
try {
	// dangerous code
	// may throw XException, YException, ...
}
catch (XException e) {
	// handle XExceptions
}
catch(YException e) {
	// handle YExceptions
}
...
finally {
	// will eventually get executed in any case
}
```

The first exception whose parameter type matches the exception is picked.

To `throw` an exception manually you would:

```java
try {
	throw(e)	// if e already exists
	throw(new XExeption())	// throw a new exception
}
catch (XException e) {
	// handle XExceptions
}
catch(YException e) {
	// handle YExceptions
}
```

## Catch or Declare
Java wants you to specify as part of a methods signature, which exceptions it may throw. This allows analysis at compile time.

### Declared Exceptions

The syntax to **declare** is:

```java
public String myMethod() throws XException {
	// method body may throw XExceptions
	// or call code that does
}
```

### Caught Exceptions

```java
public class ReadFromKeyboard {
	public static void main (String args[]) {
		// read one byte from stdin
		int myChar = System.in.read();
		// interpret that int as a char and print
		System.out.println((char) myChar);
	}
}
```

The call to `System.in.read()` can create exceptions.
{:.error}

Two fix this we could use one of the following methods:

```java
import java.io.IOExceptions;

public class ReadFromKeyboard {
	public static void main (String args[]) throws IOException {
		// read one byte from stdin
		int myChar = System.in.read();
		// interpret that int as a char and print
		System.out.println((char) myChar);
	}
}
```

This is declaring the exception.
{:.info}

```java
import java.io.IOExceptions;

public class ReadFromKeyboard {
	public static void main (String args[]) {
		try{
			// read one byte from stdin
			int myChar = System.in.read();
			// interpret that int as a char and print
			System.out.println((char) myChar);
		}
		catch(IOException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}
```

This is catching the exception.

This can be bad practice as developers can make useless catchall exception handlers.

## Throwables
Throwables allow certain types of exception to not be declared.

`java.lang` defines the following classes that can be `throw`n:

* `Error` classes is for non-recoverable situations.
* `Exception` classes are for recoverable situations.

### Unchecked Throwables
The compiler won't complain for throwables part of the following super-classes:

* `Error`
* `RuntimeException`

## `java.util` Exceptions
There are several exceptions already part of the `java.util` package:

* `ArithmeticException`
	* Arithmetical operations such as dividing by zero.
* `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`
	* Trying to access an index that is negative or bigger than the size of an array.
* `FileNotFoundException`
	* Trying to access a file that doesn't exist or is otherwise not accessible.
* `NullPointerException`
	* Reggering to memebers of a `null` object.
* `InputMismatchException`
	* Unexpected format e.g for `String` args.
	
	This is quite useful.
	{:.info}
* `StringsIndexOutOfBoundsException`
	* Using an index that is negative or beyond the length of the `String` object.

Have a look for standard exceptions before making your own.
