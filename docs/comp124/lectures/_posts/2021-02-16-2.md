title: COMP124 - Intel x86 Assembly Language & Registers 
tags: COMP124 Lectures

Writing machine code direct in binary would be too difficult and error prone. However we can do it using something called **assembly language**.

Each assembly language statement corresponds to a single machine instruction.

**Opcodes** are specified using **mnemonics** (`jmp`, `mov`)

Registers are given names and addresses are specified using **labels**. 

Labels can also be used to label lines of code to jump to.

## Single Line Example

```
adjust: mov eax, num1	; Moves num1 to eax
```

* A label can refer to the address of an instruction or the address of a data item.
	* `adjust:`
	* `num1`
* Statements like this can be translated to binary by a program called an **assembler**.
* It may also be possible to use and **in-line assembler**.
	* Allows insertion of assembly code into HLL programs.
	* Advantage of mix and match.
	
## Intel x86 Registers
The x86 also has a number of general purpose registers:

* `EAX`: Accumulator Register
* `EBX`: Base Register
* `ECX`: Counter Register
* `EDX`: Data Register

Other such as the `Flags` register and `ESP` register will be considered later.

Even though the registers have names they are general purpose so can be used for anything.

### The Accumulator
Most CPUs have an accumulator. This is a register for a general purpose data storage and computation. On an x86 CPU it looks like this:

As the word size of x86 has increased over time so have the registers. To handle backwards compatibility each word size has a different name.

### Register and Opcode Examples

```
mov eax, 42	; Put 42 into eax.
```

```
mov ax, count	; Get 16-bit variable.
```

```
mov al, 'x'	; Put ASCII	 val of 'x' in low byte.
```

```
inc eax	; Add one to eax.
```

```
add eax, 10 ; Add 10 to eax.
```

```
mov sum, eax; Store 32-bit var.
```

Note that the first operand acts as the destination.

Note that `mov var, var` is not allowed.

## Assignment
We can now handle assignment:

```python
num = count1 + count2 - 10
```

The equivalent in `asm` would be:

```
mov eax, count1
add eax, count2
sub eax, 10
mov num, eax
```

This transfers `count1` to the accumulator and then adds `count2` to the accumulator. 10 is then subtracted from the accumulator and the result is transferred to the label `num`.
