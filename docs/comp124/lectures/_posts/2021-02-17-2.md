Iteration can be achieved by jumping backwards in the code.

We need to ensure that we don't end up in an infinite loop. A `while` loop simply repeat while a given condition is true.

## `while` Loops
This codes calculates the 1000th Fibonacci number:

```java
while (fib2 < 1000) {
	fib0 = fib1;
	fib1 = fib2; 
	fib2 = fib1 + fib0;
}
```

This is the equivalent assembly code:

```
while1:
	mov eax, fib2
	cmp eax, 1000	; compare for condition
	jge end_while	; jump out of loop if condition is met
	mov eax, fib1
	mov fib0, eax
	mov eax, fib2
	mov fib1, eax
	add eax, fib0
	mov fib2, eax
	jmp while1		; jump back to start of loop
end_while:
	...
```

## `do`-`while` Loops
This is the same code using a `do`-`while` loop:

```java
do {
	fib0 = fib1;
	fib1 = fib2; 
	fib2 = fib1 + fib0;
} while (fib2 < 1000);
```

And the same code in assembly:

```
do-while:
	mov eax, fib1
	mov fib0, eax
	mov eax, fib2
	mov fib1, eax
	add eax, fib0
	mov fib2, eax
	cmp eax, 1000
	jl do-while
end_while:
	...
```

This code is more efficient than the last implementation as `fib2` is already in the accumulator for the comparison.

## `for` Loops
A counting loop can be implemented in almost exactly the same way as a `while` loop:

```java
for (int x = 1; x <= 10; x++) {
	y = y + x;
}
```

### Attempt 1

```
	mov eax, 1	; use eax as x var
floop:			; start of for loop
	add y, eax	; update y
	inc eax		; x++
	cmp eax, 10
	jle floop	; end when eax = 11
```

### Attempt 2
We can improve by counting in reverse:

```
	mov eax, 10	; start at 10
floop:			; start of for loop
	add y, eax	; update y
	dec eax		; x--
	jnz floop	; end at zero
```

### Attempt 3 - `ecx` and `loop`
The `ecx` register is the counter register and often used in loops.

In can be used iwth special jump instructions:

* JECXZ - Jump is `ecx` is zero.
* JCXZ - Jump is `cx` is zero.

It can also be used with the `loop` instruction:

```
loop <lab>	; decrement ecx
			; jump to <lab> if ecx not zero
```

So, general form to repeat a statement $n$ times: 

```
	mox ecx, n
L1:	code for statement
	loop L1
```

This would give the following for the example:

```
	mov ecx, 10	; use ecx as x var
floop:
	add y, ecx	; update y
	loop floop	; loop back to floop if ecx not zero
```

This saves another instruction.
