A subroutine is a section of code which can be invoked repeatedly as the program executes.

## Reason for Use
* Save effort in programming.
* Reduce the size of programs.
* Share code.
* Encapsulate or package a specific activity.
* Provide easy access to tried and tested code.

## Subroutines in Assembly
Before we answer the above questions, let us look at how subroutines can be declared ans used in assembly language.

The declaration of a simple procedure looks as follows:

```c
label PROC
	...
	RET	;return
label ENDP
```

The subroutine is initiated by writing `CALL label`.

`PROC` and `ENDP`  are not part of the Intel x86 instruction set. We must call a C library functions from the inline assembler.
