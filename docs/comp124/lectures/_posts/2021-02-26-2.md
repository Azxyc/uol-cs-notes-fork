A recursive subroutine is one that may call itself to perform some subsidiary task.

If a subroutine is calling itself then it makes a new stack frame for each recursion.

Recursion may also appear in the form of **mutual recursion**. 

## Factorial Example

```haskell
factorial(1) = 1
factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1)
```

In order to make a recursive function, you need a **base case**(to terminate execution) and some method to progress to the base case.

### Implementation in Java

```java
...
	static int f(int n) {
		if (n < 2) return 1;
		return n * f(n - 1);
	}
...
```

As an alternate to pattern matching we are using a `if` statement to make the decision.

### Implementation in Assembly

This will multiply the top 2 items on the stack and leave the result in EAX:

```cpp
multiply PROC
	pop ebx
	pop eax
	mov tmp, eax
	pop eax
	mul eax, tmp
	push ebx
	ret
multiply ENDP
```

```cpp
factorial PROC	; parameter n is passed via eax
	cmp eax, 2	; check if n < 2
	jl rtn1
	push eax	; push current value of n
	dex eax	; decrease the value of n
	call factorial	; recursively call factorial
	push eax	; push the result
	call multiply	; n * fac(n - 1)
	ret	; return with result in eax
rtn1:
	mov eax, 1	; zero or one factorial is 1
	ret	; return with result in eax
factorial ENDP
```

Consider computing the factorial of 3. Calling the sequence might be:

```cpp
mov eax, 3
call factorial
// now eax contains result
```

This shows the parameters that are on the stack at each call:
