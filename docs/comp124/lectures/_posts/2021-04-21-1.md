## Problem
Suppose we have an object called `Thing` which has the following method:

```java
public void inc() {
	count++;
}
```

* `count` is private to `Thing`, and is initially zero.
* Two threads, $T_1$ and $T_2$, both execute the following:

	```java
	thing.inc();
	```
	
### Indeterminacy
Assume the `inc()` method does these three things within the processor:

* Loads the value of count into a register.
* Increments the value of the register back into `count`.
* Stores the value of the register back into `count`.

The two threads could run and work perfectly **most** of the time, but sometimes the order of parallel operations might case a problem:

| $T_1$ | $T_2$ | `count` |
| :-- | :-- | --: |
| `LOAD(0)` | | 0 |
| `ADD(1)` | | 0 |
| | `LOAD(0)` | 0 |
| | `ADD(1)` | 0 |
| | `STORE(1)` | 1 |
| `STORE(1)` | | **1** |

This is called a **race condition**.

This is very hard to debug as the program will mostly work correctly as the issue is **in-determinant**.

## Mutual Exclusion
Indeterminacy arises because of possible **simultaneous** access to a shared resource.

The variable `count` in the example.

The solution is to allow only one thread to access `count` at any one time; all others must be excluded.

When a thread/process accesses any shared resource, it is in a **critical section** (**region**).

One way to enforce mutual exclusion is via **semaphores**.
