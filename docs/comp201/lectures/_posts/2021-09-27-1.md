title: COMP201 - Functional Requirements and Use Case Analysis
tags: COMP201 Lectures
---
This lecture is targeted at **coursework 1.1**.

## Requirements
Requirements can be **functional**:

* What the system should do.
* Provide a login facility that uses a username and password.

They can also be **non-functional**:

* Constrains on how the functions are provided.
* Username must be longer than six characters.

Non-functional requirements don't concern the user and relate to system services.
{:.info}

## Use Cases
These show how **external actors** interact with the system.

> A use-case is a task which the actor needs to perform with the help of the system.

Actors can be a user or another system.
{:.info}

A set of use-cases describe all possible interaction with the system.

### Actors
Actors are anything external to the system which the system interacts with.

These include:

* Human actors.
* Other systems.
* External sensors.

### Use Case Description Example
The details of each use case should also be documented by a use case description:

* Print receipt – A customer has paid for an item via a valid payment method. The till should print a receipt indicating the current date and time, the price, the payment type and the member of staff who dealt with the sale.
	* *Alternate Case* – No print paper available – Print out “Please enter new till paper” to the cashier’s terminal. Try to print again after 10 seconds.

### Use Case Diagram Example

}

"></p>

### ATM Use Case Example
* Actors
	* Customers
	* Bank staff
	* ATM service engineer
* Use cases
	* Withdraw cash
	* Check balance
	* Add cash to machine
	* Check security video recording
	
#### ATM Case Diagram

<p><img markdown=0 uml="
Actor "Bank Customer" as c
Actor "Bank Staff" as s
Actor "Service Engineer" as e
package "ATM System" {
usecase "View Balance" as vb
usecase "Withdraw Cash" as wc
usecase "Print Statement" as ps
usecase "Check Cash Stock" as ccs
usecase "Download Video Recording" as dvr
usecase "Topup Cash" as tc
}
c --- vb
c --- wc
c --- ps
s --- ccs
s --- dvr
e --- tc
"></p>

The boundary of the system is defined by the box.

### Advanced Use Case Diagrams

* Boundaries - A labelled box can be drawn around a set of use cases to denote the system boundary.
* Inheritance - Can be used between actors to show that all use cases of one actor are available to the other:

	<p><img uml="
	:Bank Staff: --> :Customer:
	"></p>
	
* Include Relations - If several use cases include another use case:

* Extend Relations - If a use case has two or more significantly different outcomes, we can show this by extending the use case to a main use case:

	*Includes* is for mandatory behaviour and *extends* is for optional/conditional behaviour.

### Use Case Template
This template should be used for coursework 1.1:

| Attribute of Use Case | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| ID | Short ID, usefull for diagrams and reference. |
| Name | Full name |
| Description | Full Description |
| Pre-condition | What muse be true before the use case can proceed. |
| Event flow | Flow of behaviour that makes up this use case. |
| Post-condition | What should be true if the use case successfully completes. |
| Includes | What other use cases are used. |
| Exensions | Optional behaviour. |
| Triggers | What makes the use case happen. |

Use cases don't describe internal behaviour and must describe behaviour with external actors.
{:.warning}

#### Example Template
These are some of the use cases for an ATM:

| ID | UC1 |
| :-- | :-- |
| Name | Withdraw Cash |
| Description | Bank customer withdraws cash from the machine |
| Pre-condition | ATM in service |
| Pre-condition | ATM has sufficient cash |
| Includes | UC2 (Authenticate Customer) |
| Event flow | Choose quick cash or enter exact amount, choose receipt option, take cash.
| Extensions | UC4 (Balance too Low) |
| Triggers | Withdraw cash request entered. |
| Post-condition | Balance updated. |

| ID | UC2 |
| :-- | :-- |
| Name | Authenticate Customer |
| Description | Bank customer proves their identity to the ATM. |
| Pre-condition | ATM in service |
| Event flow | If user is already authenticated exit from use case, user enters card PIN number, user re-enters PIN if PIN is incorrect. |
| Extensions | UC5 (Card Stolen), UC6 (Pin Entry Failure) |
| Triggers | Authenticated service requested and user not authenticated. |
| Post-condition | User is authenticated if credential are correct. |

| ID | UC3 |
| :-- | :-- |
| Name | Check Balance |
| Description | Bank customer retrieves a balance for their account. |
| Pre-condition | ATM in service |
| Includes | UC2 (Authenticate Customer) |
| Event flow | Choose onscreen or paper balance. |
| Triggers | Check balance is requested. |

| ID | UC4 |
| :-- | :-- |
| Name | Balance too Low |
| Description | Bank customer cannot make cash withdrawal due to low balance. |
| Event flow | Customer chooses smaller amount or cancels the transaction. |
| Triggers | Cash chosen is grater than available balance. |
