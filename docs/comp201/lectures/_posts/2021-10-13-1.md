title: System Models (Process Models, Data Flow & State Machines)
tags: COMP201 Lectures
---
System models are abstract descriptions of systems. They explain the details of a system in a more technical way.

* System **representations** maintain all the information of a system.
* A system **abstraction** deliberately simplifies the system and picks the most important characteristics.

## System Model Weaknesses
There are several weaknesses of system models:

* They do not model **non-functional** requirements
* They do not usually include information about whether a method is appropriate for a given problem.
* They may produce to much documentation.
* They are sometime too detailed and difficult to read to be useful.

## Class Diagram
Here is an example of a class diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
direction LR
CourseOffering "0..*" -- "1..1" Professor: teaches
CourseOffering "0..*" -- "0..*" Student: takes
Student --|> Person: extends
Professor --|> Person: extends
class CourseOffering{
	-int sectionNo
	-Course course
	-Professor instructor
	-String schedule
	-String location
	-int maxEnrollment
	-int enrollment
	-Set prerequisites
	+CourseOffering()
	+setSectionNo() void
	+setCourse() void
	+setInstructor() void
	+setSchedule() void
	+setLocation() void
	+setMaxEnrollment() void
	+get...()
	+calcAvailable() int
}
class Student{
	-String major
	-String classStanding
	-float graph
	+setMajor() void
	+setClassStanding() void
	+computeGpa void
}
class Professor{
	-String rank
	-Date tenureDate
	-String department
	+Professor()
	+setRank() void
	+setTenureDate() void
	+getRank() String
	+getTenureDate() Date
	+getDepartment() String
}
class Person{
	#String name
	#String ssn
	#Date dob
	#Person spouse
	#Set children
	+Person()
	+setName() void
	+setSsn() void
	+setDob() void
	+setSpouse() void
	+setChildren() Set
	+getName() String
	+getSsn() String
	+getDob() Date
	+getSpouse() Person
	+getChildren() Set
	+getAge() int
}
```

The information in this diagram would be significantly harder to explain in natural language.

## Model Types
The following models have their own respective purposes:

* **Data Processing Model** - Showing how that data is processed at different stages.
* **Composition Model** - Showing how entities are composed of other entities.
* **Architectural Model** - Showing principle sub-systems and relationships with other systems.
* **Classification Model** - Showing how entities have common characteristics.
* **Stimulus/Response Model** - Showing the system's reaction to events.
* **Context Models** - Are used to illustrate the boundaries of a system.
	* Social and organisation concerns may affect the decision on where to position system boundaries.

### Architectural Model of an ATM System

```plantuml
@startwbs
* ATM System
** Security System
** Account Database
** Usage Database
** Maintenance System
** Branch Counter System
** Branch Accounting System
@endwbs
```

### Process Models
There are several different types of data processing models:

* **Process Models** - Show the overall process and the processes that are supported by the system.
	* In process models it is implicit one process is completed before another process begins.
	* Process models are similar to flow charts.
* **Data Flow Models** - Are used to show the processes and the **flow of information** from one process to another.
	* In data flow models it is implicit that processes will happen in parallel.

#### Example Process Model
This is an example of the equipment procurement process:

```mermaid

4[(Supplier Database)] --> 3
3 -->|Supplier List| 5[Get Cost Estimates]

end
```

### Behavioural Models
These are used to describe the overall behaviour of the system. There are two types of behavioural model:

* **Data Processing Models** - Show how data is processed as it moves through the system.
* **State Machine Models** - Show the systems response to events.

Both of these models are required for a description of the system's behaviour.
{:.info}

#### Data-Processing Models
**Data flow diagrams** are used to model the system's data processing. These show the processing steps as data flows through a system. They should:

* Be simple and intuitive to understand.
* Show end-to-end processing os data.

This is part of many analysis  methods.
{:.info}

Data flow diagrams can also used to show data exchange between a system and other systems in its environment.
{:.info}

Data flow diagrams show a **functional perspective** where each transformation represents a single function or process. This is useful for requirements analysis as it shows end-to-end processing.

##### Example Data Flow Diagram
This is an example of order processing:

```mermaid
flowchart
1[ ] -->|Order Details & Bank Order Form| 2[Complete Order Form]
2 -->|Completed Order Form| 3[Validate Order]
3 -->|Signed Order Form| 4[Record Order]
4 -->|Order Details| 5([Orders File])
4 -->|Signed Order Form| 6[Send to Supplier]
4 -->|Signed Order Form| 7[Adjust Available Budget]
6 -->|Checked and Signed Order & Order Notification| 8[ ]
7 -->|Order Amount & Account Details| 9([Budget File])
```

##### Example Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Context Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart LR
dmc((Drinks Machine Controller)) .->|"Heating Element (on/off)"| hws[Hot Water System]
dmc .->|"Hot Water Valve (open/close)"| hws
hws ==>|Hot Water Temperature| dmc
dmc .->|"Holding Vessel Valve (open/close)"| hv[Holding Vessel]
csm[Coin Sense Mechanism] -->|Coin Codes| dmc
dmc .->|"Stirrer (on/off)"| s[Stirrer]
dmc -->|Service Request| Modem
dmc -->|Pricing, Availability and Service Information| ad[Alphanumeric Display]
dmc .->|"Cup Solenoid (on/off)"| pcm[Paper Cup Mechanism]
pcm .->|Cup in Place| dmc
nkp[Numeric Key Pad] -->|Key Codes & Drink Choice| dmc
dih[Dried Ingredients Hopper] .->|Hopper Low Signal| dmc
dmc .->|"Hopper (on/off)"| dih
```

The hot water temperature (in bold) is a **continuous** input. It should have a double arrowhead but I can't do that.
{:.info}

* **Solid** lines are information flows.
* **Dotted** lines are control flows.
* **Double** arrow heads are continuous data.
* **Single** arrow heads are discrete data.

##### Level 0 DFD
This is the top level that represents all the systems in the machine:

```mermaid
flowchart

mdc .->|"Hopper Motors (on/off)"| 6[ ]
mdc .->|"Hot Water Valve (on/off)"| 7[ ]

mdc .->|Holding Vessel Control| 8[ ]

sl -->|Sales Data| csr
Hoppers .->|Hopper Low?| oc & csr((Control Service Request))
oc -->|Price & Availability| ad[Alpha Display]
csr -->|Service Data| Modem
```

##### Level 1 DFD - Operation Control
A level 1 DFD explores a discrete system from the level 0 DFD:

```mermaid
flowchart
1[ ] .->|"Service Door (closed/open)"| cmm((Control Maintenance Mode))
kp[Key Pad] -->|Key Codes| pkc((Process Key Codes))

Hoppers .->|Hopper Low?| dac((Drink Availability Checker))
dr[(Drink Recipes)] -->|Drink Data| dac
cmm .->|"Maintenance Mode (enable/disable)"| 3[ ]
ddc -->|Paid For Drink Code| dq[(Drink Queue)]
dq -->|Paid For Drink Code| 5[ ]
pkc -->|Engineering Codes| 2[ ]
```

#### State Machine Models
State machine models, also called **state chart diagrams**, show the behaviour of the system in response to external and internal events.

* State-charts allows the decomposition of a **model** into **sub-models**.
* A brief description of the action is required. (`Do` is optional).
* Can be complemented by table describing the states and stimuli.

There are some additional hints for state machines:

* All states need an exit.
* Use an `Idle` state to show when the process isn't active.
* You don't need to have a state chart as a sub-state of another state chart.
	* The system can be described by multiple state machines running concurrently.
* Use multiple state charts to keep the design simple.

##### Example State Machine Model

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
state "do: Display Time" as w
state "do: Set power = 600" as fp
state "do: Set power = 300" as hp
state "do: get number, exit: set time" as st
state "do: Display 'Waiting'" as d
state "do: Display 'Ready'" as e
state "do: Operate Oven" as o
[*] --> w
w --> fp:Full Power
w --> hp:Half Power
fp --> hp:Half Power
hp --> fp:Full Power
fp --> st:Timer
hp --> st:Timer
st --> st:Number
st --> d:Door Open
st --> e:Door Closed
d --> e:Door Closed
e --> o:Start
o --> d:Door Open
o --> w:Cancel, Done
```

A state machine model **does not** show flow of data within the system.
{:.info}

This state graph has the associated stimuli table:

| Stimulus | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Half Power | The user has pressed the half power button. |
| Full Power | The use has pressed the full power button. |
| Timer | The user has pressed one of the timer buttons. |
| Number | Ther user has pressed a numeric key. |
| Door Open | The oven door switch is not close. |
| Door Closed | The oven door switch is closed. |
| Start | The user has pressed the start button. |
| Cancel | The user has pressed the cancel button. |

##### State Diagram with Composite States
This diagram makes use of a couple of additional features:

* **Guard** - On the arrows. Ensures that the system only moves from one state to the other if the expression is satisfied.
	* This can be a method as shown on this example.
* **Composite Sates** - This is a state sub-diagram that models the states of a state.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
ErrorState: printError()
SubsystemChecking: performCheck()
ErrorFound: printError()
state Running {
	[*] --> SystemOff
	SystemOff --> SystemOn: initiate() [canStart]
	SystemOff --> ErrorState: initate() [cannotStart]
	ErrorState --> [*]
}
state Maintenance {
	SubsystemChecking --> ErrorFound: errorReturned()
}
Running --> Maintenance: checkSystem() [notRunning]
Maintenance --> Running: printCheckReport()
```

##### Actions
You can put actions after the event using a `/`:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
direction LR
OutOfInk --> Idle: Ink Available/Clear Display 
Idle --> OutOfInk: Ink Low/Show Error Message
```
