title: Modelling Based on Petri Nets
tags: COMP201 Lectures
---
Petri nets are often used for **distributed systems** and for systems with **resource sharing**. 

Since there may be more than one transition in the Petri net active at a time and we don't know which will fire first, they are non-deterministic.

There are certain additions to Petri nets which make them **High-Level**:

* Colour - For modelling attributes.
* Time - For performance analysis.
* Hierarchy - For the structuring of models, DFD's.

## Conditions

* A transition is only enabled if each of the input places contains tokens.
* Enabled transitions can fire.
	* Firing consumes tokens from the inputs and produces tokens for the outputs according to the arcs.
	
## Example Firing
This is a sequence of firings:

1. ```mermaid
	stateDiagram-v2
	direction LR
	state T1 <<fork>>
	P1(••) --> T1
	T1 --> P2(••)
	T1 --> P3(•)
	P3(•) --> T1
	```
	
1. ```mermaid
	stateDiagram-v2
	direction LR
	state T1 <<fork>>
	P1(•••) --> T1
	T1 --> P2(•)
	T1 --> P3(•)
	P3(•) --> T1
	```
	
1. ```mermaid
	stateDiagram-v2
	direction LR
	state T1 <<fork>>
	P1(•) --> T1
	T1 --> P2(•••)
	T1 --> P3(•)
	P3(•) --> T1
	```

## Creating & Consuming Tokens
A transitions without any input can fire at any time and produces tokens in all connected places:

1. ```mermaid
	stateDiagram-v2
	direction LR
	state T1 <<fork>>
	T1 --> P1()
	```
	
1. ```mermaid
	stateDiagram-v2
	direction LR
	state T1 <<fork>>
	T1 --> P1(•)
	```
	
1. ```mermaid
	stateDiagram-v2
	direction LR
	state T1 <<fork>>
	T1 --> P1(••)
	```

A transition without any output must be enabled to fire and deletes the incoming tokens:

1. ```mermaid
	stateDiagram-v2
	direction LR
	state T1 <<fork>>
	P1(•••) --> T1
	```
	
1. ```mermaid
	stateDiagram-v2
	direction LR
	state T1 <<fork>>
	P1(••) --> T1
	```
	
1. ```mermaid
	stateDiagram-v2
	direction LR
	state T1 <<fork>>
	P1(•) --> T1
	```
	
## Non-Determinism
If two transitions fight for the same token there is a **conflict**. The next transition to fire $T1$ or $T2$ is non-deterministic:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
direction LR
state T1 <<fork>>
state T2 <<fork>>
P1(•) --> T1
P1(•) --> T2
T1 --> P2
T2 --> P3
```

Even if there are two tokens, there is still conflict.

## Modelling 

* Tokens - Can represent resources, information, conditions, or states of objects.
* Places - Can represent buffers, channels, locations, conditions, or states.
* Transitions - Represent events, transformations or transportations.

## Traffic Light Example 
To begin we will model only one traffic light:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
direction LR
state gy <<fork>>
state yr <<fork>>
state rg <<fork>>
Green --> gy
gy --> Amber
Amber --> yr
yr --> Red(•)
Red(•) --> rg
rg --> Green
```

Having two of this model would enable both sets of traffic lights to be green at the same time. To stop this we can make the following modification:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
direction LR
state gy1 <<fork>>
state yr1 <<fork>>
state rg1 <<fork>>
Green1 --> gy1
gy1 --> Amber1
Amber1 --> yr1
yr1 --> Red1(•)
Red1(•) --> rg1
rg1 --> Green1
state gy2 <<fork>>
state yr2 <<fork>>
state rg2 <<fork>>
Green2 --> gy2
gy2 --> Amber2
Amber2 --> yr2
yr2 --> Red2(•)
Red2(•) --> rg2
rg2 --> Green2
yr1 --> Safe(•)
yr2 --> Safe(•)
Safe(•) --> rg2
Safe(•) --> rg1
```

This fires the two traffic lights in random order due to the conflict with `Safe`. To make them change alternately we can use the following model:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
direction LR
state gy1 <<fork>>
state yr1 <<fork>>
state rg1 <<fork>>
Green1 --> gy1
gy1 --> Amber1
Amber1 --> yr1
yr1 --> Red1(•)
Red1(•) --> rg1
rg1 --> Green1
state gy2 <<fork>>
state yr2 <<fork>>
state rg2 <<fork>>
Green2 --> gy2
gy2 --> Amber2
Amber2 --> yr2
yr2 --> Red2(•)
Red2(•) --> rg2
rg2 --> Green2
yr1 --> Safe1(•)
yr2 --> Safe2()
Safe1(•) --> rg2
Safe2() --> rg1
```

## Definitions

* **Current State (Marking)** - The configuration of the tokens over the places.
	* This is described by a tuple.
*  **Reachable State** - A state reachable from the current state by firing a sequence of enabled transitions.
* **Deadlock State** - A state where no transition is enabled.

### Examples
For the following graph:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
direction LR
state br <<fork>>
state rr <<fork>>
state bb <<fork>>
Red(•••) --> rr:2
rr --> Black(••)
Black(••) --> bb:2
bb --> Black(••)
Black(••) --> br
br --> Red(•••)
Red(•••) --> br
```

```
State: (3,2)
```

This is because we are ordering the tuple `(Red,Black)` and there are three tokens in `Red` and two tokens in `Black`.

We can also graph the reachable states and deadlock states in a tree:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
32["(3,2)"] -->|rr| 13
13["(1,3)"] -->|bb, br| 12["(1,2)"]
12 -->|bb, br| 11["(1,1)"]
11 -->|br| 10["(1,0)"]
32 -->|bb,br| 31["(3,1)"]
31 -->|rr| 12
31 -->|br| 30["(3,0)"]
30 -->|rr| 11
```

There are 7 reachable states and one deadlock state.

Reachable are those down stream from your current place and deadlock states are those with no transitions out.
