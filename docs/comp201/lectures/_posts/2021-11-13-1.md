	**Dynamic binding** is where you write:
	
	```java
	B temp = new C();
	```
	
	This is where we use the methods from $C$ on an object of type $B$. It is called **up-casting**.

## Summary

* Objects can have their own **private** state and operations.
* Objects should have a **constructor** as well as
**inspection** operations. They provide services to
other objects.
* Objects may be implemented **sequentially** or
**concurrently**.
* Object **interfaces** should be **defined precisely**
using, ideally using an object oriented language.
* Object-oriented design potentially simplifies
system evolution.
* The **Unified Modelling Language** provides
different notations for defining different object
models.
