Interaction diagrams record how objects interact to perform a particular use-case.

## Collaboration Diagrams
Collaboration diagrams show links, objects and actors.

The labelled arrows show a message sent from one object to another.

<p><img uml='
actor "aMember:BookBorrower" as member
[theLibraryMember:\nLibraryMember] as librarymember
member -- librarymember:borrow(theCopy) >
librarymember -- librarymember:1: okToBorrow >
[theCopy:Copy] as copy
librarymember -- copy:2: borrow >
[theBook:Book] as book
copy -r- book:2.1: borrowed >
'></p>

The objects are named as `objectName:className`.

## Sequence Diagrams
This is the same events as before, shown in a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
actor bb as aMember:BookBorrower
participant lm as theLibraryMember:LibraryMember
participant c as theCopy:Copy
participant b as theBook:Book
activate bb
bb ->> lm:borrow(theCopy)
activate lm
lm ->> lm:1: okToBorrow
lm ->> c:2: borrow
activate c
c ->> b:2.1: borrowed
activate b
deactivate b
deactivate c
deactivate lm
deactivate bb
```

* Messages are shown as solid lines.
* Returns are shown as dotted lines.

### Timing Constraints
You can show timing constraints like so:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
actor bb as aMember:BookBorrower
participant lm as theLibraryMember:LibraryMember
participant c as theCopy:Copy
participant b as theBook:Book
activate bb
note over bb:A
bb ->> lm:borrow(theCopy)
activate lm
lm ->> lm:1: okToBorrow
note over bb:{C-A < 5 secs}
lm ->> c:2: borrow
activate c
note left of b:{borrowed'-borrowed < 1 sec}
c ->> b:2.1: borrowed
activate b
deactivate b
deactivate c
lm -->> bb: 
deactivate lm
note over bb:C
deactivate bb
```

## Creating & Deleting Objects
In collaboration diagrams:

* You can show if objects are created and destroyed by labelling them with `{new}` and `{destroyed}`.
* If an object is created and destroyed in the same interaction, it can be labelled `{transit}`.

<p><img uml='
actor ":UTO" as UTO
component ":Lecturer {destroyed}" as Lecturer
component ":DirectorOfStudies {new}" as DirectorOfStudies
UTO -r- Lecturer:1: n := getName() >
UTO -r- Lecturer:3: destroy() >
UTO -- DirectorOfStudies:2: new DirectorOfStudies(n) >
'></p>

You can create and delete objects in a sequence diagram like so:

<p><img uml='
actor ":UTO" as UTO
participant ":Lecturer" as Lecturer
participant ":DirectorOfStudies" as DirectorOfStudies
activate UTO
UTO ->> Lecturer:1: n := getName()
activate Lecturer
deactivate Lecturer
create DirectorOfStudies
UTO ->> DirectorOfStudies:2: new DirectorOfStudies(n)
UTO ->> Lecturer:3: destroy()
destroy Lecturer
deactivate UTO
'></p>

## Messages from an Object to Itself
If an object sends a message to itself you can use the Java keyword `this`. This will call the method on the existing object.

Omitting messages from an object to itself, for internal computation, can be used as a form of **abstraction**.

## Packages
We can split of a **sub-collaboration** into a package in order to simplify a collaboration:

* Collaboration - Collection of objects and links between them.
* Sub-Collaboration - A subset of the objects together with the links connecting those objects.

## Activity Diagrams
The following is an example of an activity diagram:

```mermaid
stateDiagram
state j1 <<join>>
state f2 <<fork>>
state member {
state br <<choice>>
[*] --> br
br --> fb:borrower
br --> wq:returner
fb --> wq
fb: Find Book on Shelf
wq: Wait in Queue
f2 --> [*]
}
wq --> j1
state librarian {
state br2 <<choice>>
j1 --> br2
state f1 <<fork>>
br2 --> f1:returning
br2 --> rb:borrowing
rb:Record Borrowing
f1 --> rr
rr:Record Return
f1 --> pb
pb:Put Book Back on Shelf
state j2 <<join>>
rr --> j2
pb --> j2
rb --> pn
pn:Prepare for Next Member
j2 --> pn

pn --> f2
f2 --> j1
}
```

It has the following components:

* **Activity** - A task to complete.
* **Transition** - Moving from one activity to another.
* **Synchronisation Bar** - Describes the coordination of activities.
* **Decision Diamond** - Can be used to show decisions.
* **Start/Stop Markers** - The same as state diagrams.

There are several differences between activity diagrams and state diagrams:

* Activity diagrams don't normally include **events**.
* Activities are intended to proceed, following the flow described by the diagram. Usually one of the **guards** of an edge leaving an activity should be satisfied.
* Concurrent activities can be modelled by using the synchronisation bar notation.
