1. **For a large project, why is a detailed software design important?**

	A detailed software design is made for the developers to help them in implementing the software.

	This is important as in a system with that many sub-systems and components there needs to be strict requirements concerning the communication between each of the sub-systems. This means developing:
	
	* Classes/Packages
		* Should be re-useable on future systems.
	* Methods for complying with legislation:
		* Securing customer details
	* Testing Methods

	With so many developers people may have different ideas about how the different parts of the system are implemented. Therefore a detailed software design is both:

	* Consistent
	* Complete

	This is important as the design should detail every part of the system so that it can be implemented properly and shouldn't contradict itself.
	
1. **List the benefits of the following java keywords**:
	
	* `private` - This enables **encapsulation** which is good as it limits **coupling**.
	* `package` - This is a collection of classes. Classes in the package are private unless otherwise specified.
	* `class` - This creates objects which are good as they enable **object cohesion** which is a strong level of cohesion. They also encapsulate the data with code.
	* `extends` - This is good as it enables code re-use.
	
	High cohesion, low coupling code is good as it enables code reuse.
