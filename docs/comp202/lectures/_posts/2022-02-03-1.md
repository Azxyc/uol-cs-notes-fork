This type of notation allows for the characterisation of the main factors affecting running time. 

## Big-O Notation

Given two positive functions (algorithms) $f(n)$ and $g(n)$, defined on non-negative integers, we say: 

$$
f(n) \text{ is } O(g(n))
$$

or equivalently:

$$
f(n) \in O(g(n))
$$

if there are constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that:

$$
\forall n\geq n_0, f(n)\leq c\cdot g(n)
$$

We want to see what it takes to make $g$ be greater than $f$.

This can also be represented in the following graph:

### Big-O Example
Consider the example of:

$$
7n - 4\in O(n)
$$

To validate this we need to find constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that:

$$
\forall n\geq n_0, 7n-4\leq cn
$$

We could choose the values:

* $c=7$
* $n_0=1$

In order to satisfy the inequality we could have chosen any real numbeer $c\geq7$ and any integer $n_0\geq1$.
