This type of notation allows for the characterisation of the main factors affecting running time. 

## Big-O Notation

Given two positive functions (algorithms) $f(n)$ and $g(n)$, defined on non-negative integers, we say: 

$$
f(n) \text{ is } O(g(n))
$$

or equivalently:

$$
f(n) \in O(g(n))
$$

if there are constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that:

$$
\forall n\geq n_0, f(n)\leq c\cdot g(n)
$$

We want to see what it takes to make $g$ be greater than $f$.

This can also be represented in the following graph:

### Big-O Example
Consider the example of:

$$
7n - 4\in O(n)
$$

To validate this we need to find constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that:

$$
\forall n\geq n_0, 7n-4\leq cn
$$

We could choose the values:

* $c=7$
* $n_0=1$

In order to satisfy the inequality we could have chosen any real numbeer $c\geq7$ and any integer $n_0\geq1$.

There are additional big-O examples [in the slides](https://liverpool.instructure.com/courses/47215/files/6802864/download?download_frd=1).

### $\Omega(n)$ & $\Theta(n)$ Notation
* We say that $f(n)$ is $\Omega(g(n))$ (big-Omega) if there are real constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that:

	$$
	\forall n\geq n_0 f(n)\geq cg(n)
	$$

* We say the $f(n)$ is $\Theta(g(n))$ (big-Theta) if $f(n)$ is $\Omega(g(n))$ and $f(n)$ is also $O(g(n))$. 

You can see and example of this in the following graphs:

## Renter's Dilemma
Consider that to **rent a film it costs $x$** but to **buy it, it costs $10\times x$**. We want to decide when would be the best time to buy the film.

### Online vs. Offline Algorithms

* **Online Setting** - Requests arrive sequentially and upon arrival they must be dealt with immediately.
* **Offline Setting** - The entire sequence of events are given and the optimal solution must be chosen.

### Competitive Analysis
This is the process of comparing a given **online algorithm** $A$ to an optimal **offline algorithm** $OPT$.

We can say that, given a sequence of requests $R=(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n)$, the costs of using either algorithm are calculated like so:

* cost($OPT,R$)
* cost($A, R$)

Algorithm $A$ is **c-competitive**, for some $c\geq1$, for $R$ if:

$$
\text{cost}(A,r)\leq c\cdot \text{cost}(OPT,R)+b
$$

for some constant $b>0$.
