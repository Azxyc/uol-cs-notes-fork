This course will use the following types of proof:

* [Proof by mathematical induction]({{site.baseurl}}/comp109/lectures/2020/10/28/2.html#induction).
	* There is also [an example of mathematical induction]({{site.baseurl}}/comp109/lectures/2020/10/29/1.html).
* [Proof by contradiction]({{site.baseurl}}/comp109/lectures/2020/10/26/1.html#proof-by-contradiction).
* [Proof by contrapositive argument]({{site.baseurl}}/comp109/lectures/2020/10/26/1.html#proof-by-contraposition).
* [(Dis)Proof by counterexample]({{site.baseurl}}/comp109/lectures/2020/10/25/1.html#disproving-universal-statement-by-counterexample).

I won't cover these here, as they have been covered before, but there are [additional examples in the slides](https://liverpool.instructure.com/courses/47215/files/6802864/download?download_frd=1).
