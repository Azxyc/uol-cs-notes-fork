## Symmetric Key Cryptography
This topic has been covered before in:

* [COMP211 - Symmetric Key Cryptography]({{site.baseurl}}/comp211/lectures/2021/11/22/2.html)

### One-Time Pad
This is one of the most secure ciphers known.

For this encryption scheme Alice and Bob share a **random** bit string $K$ that is as long as any message that are going to send.

This key $K$ is the **symmetric key** that is used for the encryption and decryption process.

Although is is very secure and fast to compute, Alice and Bob must share very long keys $K$ which are used only once. This gives a lot of overhead.

#### One-Time Pad Encryption
1. To encrypt the message $M$, Alice computes:

	$$
	C=M\oplus K
	$$

	$\oplus$ is the exclusive or (XOR) operation.
	{:.info}
1. Alice then sends $C$ to Bob on any reliable communication channel. The communication is secure because $C$ is computationally indistinguishable from a **random** bit string. 

	This relies highly on the fact that $K$ was selected randomly.
	{:.warning}

#### One-Time Pad Decryption
Bob can easily decrypt the cipher-text $C$ to recover $M$ using the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
C\oplus K &=(M\oplus K)\oplus K\\
&= M\oplus (K\oplus K)\\
&= M\oplus 0\\
&= M
\end{aligned}
$$

where 0 represents the all-zero string with the same length as $M$.

## Number Theory
The following methods allow us to devise a solution for public key cryptography.

### Divisibility
Given integers $a$ and $b$, we use the notation $a\vert b$ to denote that $b$ is a multiple of $a$.

If $a\vert b$ then there is another integer $k$ such that $b=a\times k$. We note the following properties about this divisibility relationship:

**Theorem:** Let $a,b,c$ be integers:

1. If $a\vert b$ and $b\vert c$ then $a\vert c$ (transitivity).
1. If $a\vert b$ and $a\vert c$ then $a\vert(i\times b +j\times c)$ for all integers $i$ and $j$.
1. If $a\vert b$ and $b\vert a$ then either $a=b$ or $a=-b$.

### Prime Numbers and Composite Numbers
Integers that are **not prime** are **composite**.

**Theorem:** Let $n>1$ be an integer. Then there is a unique set of prime numbers $\{p_1, \ldots,p_k\}$ and positive integers $\{e_1,\ldots,e_k\}$ such that:

$$
n=p_1^{e_1}\times\ldots\times p_k^{e_k}
$$

The product $p_1^{e_1}\times\ldots\times p_k^{e_k}$ is known as the **prime decomposition** of $n$. It is unique, up to the ordering of the primes in the factorisation.

### Greatest Common Divisor
Let $a$ and $b$ denote positive integers. The greatest common dividor of $a$ and $b$, denoted $\text{gcd}(a,b)$, is the **largest** integers that divides both $a$ and $b$.

If $\text{gcd}(a,b)=1$, then we say that $a$ and $b$ are **relatively prime**.
{:.info}

The definition of the GCD can be extended like so:

* If $a>0$, then $\text{gcd}(a,0)=\text{gcd}(0,a)=a$.
* $\text{gcd}(a,b)=\text{gcd}(\lvert a\rvert,\lvert b\rvert)$ if $a$ and/or $b$ is negative.
* $\text{gcd}(0,0)$ is **undefined** as there is no largest integer that divides 0.

**Theorem:** If $d=\text{gcd}(a,b)$, then there exist integers $j$ and $k$ such that:

$$
d=j\times a +k\times b
$$

In other words, the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is expressible as a **linear combination** of $a$ and $b$:

| Function | Expression |
| :-- | :-- |
| $\text{gcd}(56,24)=8$ | $8=1\times 56 +(-2)\times(24)$ |
| $\text{gcd}(25,32)=1$ | $1=5\times 25 +(-4)\times 31$ |
| $\text{gcd}(45,25)=5$ | $5=(-1)\times 45 +2\times 25$ |
| $\text{gcd}(57,363)=3$ | $3=57\times 51 +(-8)\times 363$ |

### Modulo Operator
For $b>0$, the modulo operator, denoted by $a\mod b$, defines the remainder of $a$ when divided by $b$. That is $r=a\mod b$ means that:

$$
r=a-\left\lfloor\frac a b\right\rfloor b
$$

This means that $r$ is always an integer in the set $\{0,1,\ldots,b-1\}$ (even when $a$ is negative), and there is an integer $q$ such that:

$$
a=q\times b +r
$$

#### Congruences
$a$ is **congruent** to $b$ modulo $n$ if the following is true:

$$
a \mod n = b\mod n
$$

We can write this as:

$$
a\equiv b\pmod n
$$

In other words, if $a\equiv b \pmod n$, then $a-b=kn$ for some integer $k$. We can see this in the following example:

$$
16\equiv 8\pmod2
$$

as $16-8$ is a multiple of 2.

## Euclid's Algorithm
Euclid's algorithm is a method to fine the greatest common divisor of two integers $a$ and $b$. This algorithm relies on the following property:

**Theorem:** Suppose $a\geq b>0$, then:

$$
\text{gcd}(a,b) = \text{gcd}(b,a\mod b)
$$

### Euclid's Algorithm Pseudo-Code

EuclidGCD(a, b)

Input: $a$ and $b$ are non-negative and not both zero.  
Output: $\text{gcd}(a,b)$

```
while b != 0 do
	(a, b) = (b, a mod b)
return a
```

If $b=0$, this routine will return the value of $a$. This is correct under our assumption that $a$ and $b$ are not both zero.
{:.info}

### Euclid's Algorithm Example
We can display this algorithm in a table:

| | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| $a$ | 412 | 260 | 152 | 108 | 44 | 20 | 4 |
| $b$ | 260 | 152 | 108 | 44 | 20 | 4 | 0 |

hence $\text{gcd}(412, 260)=4$.

### Euclid's Algorithm Time Complexity
For $i>0$, let $a_i$ denote the first element of the ordered pair during the $i^\text{th}$ step in the while loop. The second argument is equal to $a_{a+1}$, so:

$$
a_{i+2} = a_i\mod a_{i+1}
$$

This implies that, after the first time through the loop, the sequence $a_i$ is strictly deceasing.

We can show that $a_{i+2}<\frac 1 2 \times a_i$. This lead the following result:

**Theorem:** Let $a,b$ be two positive integers. Euclid's algorithm computes $\text{gcd}(a,b)$ by executing:

$$
O(\log(\max(a,b)))
$$

arithmetic operations.

## Public-Key Cryptography
A public-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption function $E$ and a decryption function $D$. For any message $M$, the following properties must hold:

1. Both E and D are easy to compute for the following:

	$$
	D(E(M))=M\\
	E(D(M))=M
	$$
1. It is computationally infeasible to derive D from E.
1. The knowledge of the encryption method gives no information about the decryption scheme. Anybody can send a private message to the hold of the function $D$, but only that person knows how to decrypt it. 

	For this reason $E$ is referred to as a one-way, or trapdoor, function.
	{:.info}
	
	In this kind of encryption method $E$ is made public and $D$ is kept private.
1. The recipient of a message should be able to verify that it came from the sender, assuming that the sender is the only person who has a the private key.
	
	This is referred to as **digital signatures**.
