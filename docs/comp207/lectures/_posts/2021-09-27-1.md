## Relational Databases

* Data is organised into **tables**.
	* Tables have a **table name**.
	* Tables have **attributes** (columns).
		* All elements in a column are of the same **datatype**.
	* Tables have **tuples** (rows).
	* Each table has a **schema**. This lists the attributes of a table e.g:
		* `Items(name,price,number)`

## Tables
Tables typically have:

* Few columns that are fixed.
* A variable number of rows.

### Rows
Each row corresponds to an **entity**, or a **relationship** between entities.

* Each row corresponds to the same kind of entity or relation.
	* This could be a table of many employees details or many transactions.
* If two rows are the same they are the **same item**, as opposed to two identical items.

## SQL
Relational databases are accessed using SQL (standard query language). This standard is updated every few years but implementations may not exactly follow the standard.

### SQL Parts

* Data Definition Language (DDL)
	* Create/alter/delete databases, tables and their attributes.
* Data Manipulation Language (DML)
	* Add/remove/update and query rows in tables.
* Transact-SQL
	* Completing a **sequence** of SQL statements.
