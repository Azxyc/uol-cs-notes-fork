This covers how to:

* Create
* Alter
* Delete

databases, tables and their attributes.

## Create a Database
Databases are similar to a folder and are initially empty. They can be filled with tables.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE databasename;
```

The commands in SQL are not case-sensitive. Conventionally, they are in upper-case.

## Creating Tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE Table_name (
	column1 datatype,
	column2 datatype,
	column3 datatype
);
```

You can use whatever type of white-space you want to separate key-words.
{:.info}

The schema of this table would be:

```
Table_name(column1, column2, column3)
```

### Dataypes

| Datatype | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `INT` | Integers |
| `FLOAT` | Floating-point numbers |
| `CHAR(x)` | Fixed length string of length `x`. Spaces are required for padding. |
| `VARCHAR(x)` | Variable length string of max length `x`. |
| `DATE` | Date of format `YYY-MM-DD`. |
| `DATETIME` | Format of `YYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS`. |
| `XML` | For XML files. |
| `BLOB` | For binary files. |

There are also other data-types for other precisions.

### Example
For the following table:

| birthday | first_name | family_name |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1990-11-10 | Anne | Smith |
| 2000-02-05 | David | Jones |

You would use the following command to create an appropriate table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
	birthday DATE,
	first_name VARCHAR(100),
	family_name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

The schema of this table would be:

```
Employees(birthday, first_name, family_name)
```

### Unique
You can specify that you want some attributes to be unique per entry:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
	birthday DATE,
	first_name VARCHAR(100),
	family_name VARCHAR(100)
	CONSTRAINT UC_Employees UNIQUE(birthday, first_name)
);
```

`UC_Employess` is just a reference so that we can refer to the constraint.
{:.info}

### Primary Key
You can specify how the data should be sorted physically in storage by defining a **primary key**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
	birthday DATE,
	first_name VARCHAR(100),
	family_name VARCHAR(100)
	CONSTRAINT PK_Employees PRIMARY KEY(birthday, first_name)
);
```

* There can only be one primary key constraint per table.
* Rows in a primary key must be unique.

### Foreign Key
A foreign key is used to link tow tables together explicitly:

* It points from some attributes in one table (the child table) to the primary key of another (the parent table).
* It ensures that the values, in the attributes of the foreign key in the child table, must also be in the parent table.
* Can be used to create **custom data-types**, by having a table with all the values you want to allow.

1. Create the parent table:
 
	```sql
	CREATE TABLE Employees (
		e_id INT,
		first_name VARCHAR(100),
		family_name VARCHAR(100)
		CONSTRAINT PK_Employees PRIMARY KEY(e_id)
	);
	```

2. Create a child table referencing the parent table:
	
	```sql
	CREATE TABLE Transaction (
		emp_id INT,
		CONSTRAINT FK_Transactions FOREIGN KEY (emp_id)
			REFERENCES Employees(e_id)
	);
	```

## Deleting
Deleting is called `DROP` in SQL. To delete a database you would use:

```sql
DROP DATABASE CS_Store;
```

To delete a table:

```sql
DROP TABLE Employees;
```

You can also remove unique, primary key or foreign keys. You should look this up if required.

## Modifying Tables
To alter a table adding an attribute you could:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD email VARCHAR(100);
```

To alter and existing attribute:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees MODIFY email VARCHAR(200);
```

This allows longer emails under the `email` attribute.
{:.info}

The `MODIFY` keyword is variable depending on the implementation.
{:.warning}

To remove a column you must modify the table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees DROP COLUMN email;
```
