Queries are not covered in this lecture and will have their own notes.

## Insert
For the following table:

| name | number | programme |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Anna | 20171989 | G402 |
| John | 20174378 | G702 |

If you want to insert a value you would use the following command:

```sql
INSERT INTO Students VALUES('Oliver', 20171112, 'G402');
```

`'` is used to denote the start and end of a string and not `"`.
{:.warning}

To insert a tuple while missing an attribute you can use the following:

```sql
INSERT INTO Students(programme, name) VALUES('G702', 'Danny');
```

The unused attribute will be filled with `null`.

## Comments
In the SQL languages `--` is used to denote comments.

## Delete
To remove an entry from the result of a simple query you can do the following:

```sql
DELETE FROM Students WHERE name='John';
```

If you write `DELETE FROM Students;` you will remove all the entries from the table.

## `WHERE` Clauses
For comparisons you can use the following:

* `=`,`<`,`<=`,`>=`,`>`
* You can also use `<>` or `!=` for the last item.

You can also use some boolean operations:

* `AND`
* `OR`
* `NOT`
* `BETWEEN`
	* E.g. `Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20`.
* `LIKE`
	* `_` matches single characters.
	* `%` matches any number of characters.
	
For combinations you can use the following:

```sql
... WHERE name='Oliver' AND programme='G402';
```

### `IN`
To specify a set to match against you can use the `IN` keyword:

```sql
DELETE FROM Students WHERE name IN('John','Sebastian');
```

## Updating
To update the contents of a row you can do the following:

```sql
UPDATE Students SET programme='G402' WHERE name='Oliver';
```

You can also update programatically:

```sql
UPDATE Students SET number=number+1 WHERE name='Oliver';
```
