If $S$ is a schedule containing only 2PL transactions, then $S$ is conflict-serialisable.

> Claim: We can move all operation of $T_i$ to the beginning of the schedule (using swaps of consecutive non-conflicting operations).

No formal definition is given in this proof so it is better to watch [the video](https://liverpool.instructure.com/courses/46572/pages/2pl-ensures-conflict-serializability) (proof starts at 1:33).
