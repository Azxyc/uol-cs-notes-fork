## Redo Logging
Logs activities with the goal of **restoring** committed transactions (ignoring incomplete
transactions).

Log Records:

* Same records as before and...
* New meaning of `<T, X, v>`:
	* Transaction T has updated
the value of database item $X$ and the new value of $X$ is $v$.
		* Direct response to write(X)
	
		This happens before $X$ is changed on disk.

### Redo Logging Procedure

1. $T$ first writes all log records for all updates.
1. $T$ writes `<COMMIT T>` to the log on disk.
1. $T$ writes all committed updates to disk. 

Redo logging has the two following fundamental principles:

* `<COMMIT t>` occurs in the log only when the log contains complete information on $T$.
* `<COMMIT t>` doesn't occur in the log when $T$ hasn't written anything to disk.

There is also the following syntax:

* `outcom(X)` - Outputs the last committed value from buffer to disk.

### Redo Logging Example 

| Time | Transaction | $X$ (Local) | $Y$ (Local) | $X$ (Buffer) | $Y$ (Buffer) | $X$ (Database) | $Y$ (Database) | Log Record Written |
| --: | :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | :-- |
| 0 | | | | | | 1 | 10 | `<START T>` |
| 1 | read(X) | **1** | | **1** | | 1 | 10 | | 
| 2 | X := X * 2 | **2** | | 1 | | 1 | 10 | |
| 3 | write(X) | 2 | | **2** | | 1 | 10 | `<T, X, 1>` |
| 4 | read(Y) | 2 | **10** | 2 | **10** | 1 | 10 | |
| 5 | Y := Y * 2 | 2 | **20** | 2 | 10 | 1 | 10 | |
| 6 | write(Y) | 2 | 20 | 2 | **20** | 1 | 10 | `<T, Y, 10>`|
| 7 | |  |  |  |  |  | | `<COMMIT T>` |
| 8 | flush_log |  |  |  |  |  |  | (Log buffer is written to disk.) |
| 9 | outcom(X) | 2 | 20 | 2 | 20 | **2** | 10 | ($X$ is written from buffer to database.) |
| 10 | outcom(Y) | 2 | 20 | 2 | 20 | 2 | **20** | ($Y$ is written from buffer to database.) |

### Recovery with Redo Logging
This is essentially the reverse of undo logging:

1. Identify all the transactions with a `COMMIT` log record.
1. Traverse the log from first to the last item.
1. If we see `<T, X, v>` and $T$ has a `COMMIT` log record, then change the value of $X$ on disk to $v$.
1. For each incomplete transaction $T$, write `<ABORT T>` into the log on disk.

## Undo/Redo Logging
This combines the atomicity and durability of undo and redo logging.

Log Records:

* Same as before but replace `<T, X, v>`.
* `<T, X, v, w>` - Transaction $T$ has updates the value of database item $X$, and the old and new values of $X$ are $v$ and $w$ respectively. 

### Undo/Redo Logging Procedure

1. Write all log records for all updates to database items first. 
1. Then write updates to disk.
1. `<COMMIT T>` can then be written to disk before or after all change have been written to disk. 

Recovery needs to process the log in both directions.

### Undo/Redo Logging Example
Consider the following schedule that needs to be logged using undo/redo logging where:

* $X=1$
* $Y=2$

| $T_1$ | $T_2$ |
| :-- | :-- |
| read(X) | |
| X := X * 2 | |
| write(X) | |
| | read(X) |
| read (Y) | | 
| | X := X * 3 |
| | write(X) |
| Y := Y + Y | |
| write(Y) | |

We can put this in the following table:

| Time | Transaction $T_1$ | Transaction $T_2$ | Local $T_1$ $X$ | Local $T_1$ $Y$ | Local $T_2$ $X$ | Local $T_2$ $Y$ | Buffer $X$ | Buffer $Y$ | Disk $X$ | Disk $Y$ | Buffer Log |
| --: | :-- | :-- | --: | --: |  --: |  --: |  --: |  --: |  --: |  --: | :-- |
| 0 | | | | | | | | | 1 | 2 | `<START T1>` |
| 1 | read(X) | | **1** | | | | **1** | | 1 | 2 | |
| 2 | X := X * 2 | | **2** | | | | 1 | | 1 | 2 | |
| 3 | write(X) | | 2 | | | | **2**| | 1 | 2 | `<T1, X, 1, 2>` |
| 4 | | | 2 | | | | 2 | | 1 | 2 | `<START T2>` |
| 5 | | read(X) | 2 | | **2** | | 2 | | 1 | 2 | | 
| 6 | read(Y) | | 2 | **2** | 2 | | 2 | **2** | 1 | 2 | |
| 7 | | X := X * 3 | 2 | 2 | **6** | | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 | |
| 8 | | write(X) | 2 | 2 | 6 | | **6** | 2 | 1 | 2 | `<T1, X, 2, 6>` |
| 9 | Y := X + Y | | 2 | **4** | 5 | | 6 | 2 | 1 | 2 | |
| 10 | write(Y) | | 2 | 4 | 6 | | 6 | **4** | 1 | 2 | `<T1, Y, 2, 4>` |
| 11 | | | 2 | 4 | 6 | | 6 | 4 | 1 | 2 | `<COMMIT T1>` |
| 12 | flush_log | | 2 | 4 | 6 | | 6 | 4 | 1 | 2 | (Log is written to disk) |
| 13 | output(X) | | 2 | 4 | 6 | | 6 | 4 | **6** | 2 | |
| 14 | output(Y) | | 2 | 4 | 6 | | 6 | 4 | 6 | **4** | |
| 15 | | | 2 | 4 | 6 | | 6 | 4 | 6 | 4 | `<COMMIT T2>` |
| 16 | | flush_log | 2 | 4 | 6 | | 6 | 4 | 6 | 4 | (Logs since last flush are written to disk) |
| 17 | | output(X) | 2 | 4 | 6 | | 6 | 4 | 6 | 4 | No change |

### Undo without Redo (Force)
Undo ensures **atomicity**.

We can ensure **durability** by using **force**:

* This forces the writing of updates to disk **before commit**.
	
	**No force** is the opposite of this.
	{:.info}
* Force is expensive in disk operations.

### Redo without Undo (No Steal)
Redo ensures **durability**. 

We can ensure **atomicity** by using **no steal**:

* No steal means that uncommitted data may **not overwrite committed data** on disk.
	
	Steal is not to require this.
	{:.info}
* No steal is expensive to ensure.

### Ensuring Atomicity & Durability
We could ensure atomicity and durability **without a log** by using no steal and force, however this is:

* Hard and expensive to ensure.
	* Must write every change to disk made by the transaction while performing the commit. 

In practice we use undo/redo as it is **cheap** and ensures atomicity and durability.
