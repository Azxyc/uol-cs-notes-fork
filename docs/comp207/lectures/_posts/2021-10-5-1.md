These aren't required to form a valid query and are extensions to standard queries.
{:.info}

SQL queries have the following form:

```sql
SELECT [] FROM [] WHERE [] GROUP BY [] HAVING [] ORDER BY []
```

The first two parts are required to have a valid query.
{:.info}

## `WHERE`
This is already mostly covered in [SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML)]({{site.baseurl}}/comp207/lectures/2021/09/29/1.html).

### `IN`
In addition to providing a list like [here]({{site.baseurl}}/comp207/lectures/2021/09/29/1.html#in) you can also use sub-queries:

```sql
DELETE FROM Students WHERE name IN (SELECT name FROM Lecturers);
```

you can also do the same for a `SELECT` query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE name IN (SELECT name FROM Lecturers);
```

### `EXISTS`
This is a generalisation of `IN`.  With `EXISTS` you can write a sub-query and if it returns something, the current row will be kept, otherwise thrown out. You can use attributes from the current row in the sub-query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Students
WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1
	FROM Lecturers
	WHERE Students.name=Lecturers.name AND Students.last_name=Lecturers.last_name);
```

It is common to use the constant `1` when we just want to have an output or not.

### Semi-Join
Most types on joins are done in the `FROM` clause. The only difference is semi-joins that are done from `WHERE` clauses.

A **left** semi-join between two tables $A$ and $B$, finds the subset of row in $A$ that would be used to form some row of the natural join of $A$ and $B$.

A **right** semi-join would find the subset of $B$ instead.
{:.info}

These are done using `EXISTS` (or `IN`, if there is only one shared attribute).

#### Example
We will complete a **left** semi-join for the following tables (Employees to Transactions):

| birthday | first_name | family_name | e_id |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | --: |
| 1990-11-10 | Anne | Smith | 1 |
| 200-02-05 | David | Jones | 2 |
| 1995-05-09 | William | Taylor | 3 |

| t_id | c_id | e_id |
| --: | --: | --: |
| 1 | 3 | 1 |
| 2 | 6 | 1 |
| 3 | 19 | 3 |

We would use the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees E
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1
	FROM Transaction T
	WHERE E.e_id=T.e_id);
```

This gives the following output:

| birthday | first_name | family_name | e_id |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | --: |
| 1990-11-10 | Anne | Smith | 1 |
| 1995-05-09 | William | Taylor | 3 |

Notice that only one `Anne` row is output even though two transactions where done under here `e_id`. This is as this method can only remove rows.
{:.info}

### `GROUP BY`
`GROUP BY` allows you to count transactions for each employee rather than just for one by using a `WHERE` clause. For the following tables:

| birthday | first_name | family_name | e_id |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | --: |
| 1990-11-10 | Anne | Smith | 1 |
| 200-02-05 | David | Jones | 2 |
| 1995-05-09 | William | Taylor | 3 |

| t_id | c_id | e_id |
| --: | --: | --: |
| 1 | 3 | 1 |
| 2 | 6 | 1 |
| 3 | 19 | 3 |

You could count the number of transactions for all `e_id` using the following query:

```sql
SELECT e_id, COUNT(t_id)
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY e_id;
```

This would return the following table:

| e_id | COUNT(t_id) |
| --: | --: |
| 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 1 |

Notice how the behaviour of `COUNT` changes due to the iteration.
{:.info}

#### Complications
When using `GROUP BY` you can only include in `SELECT` attributes that we `GROUP BY` or aggregates.

There are a couple of ways to overcome this:

* Including additional attributes into the `GROUP BY` statement:

	```sql
	SELECT first_name, e_id, COUNT(t_id)
	FROM Employees NATURAL JOIN Transactions
	GROUP BY first_name, e_id;
	```
	
	This seems like my preferred method.
	{:.info}
* Including the additional attribute in an aggregate:
	
	```sql
	SELECT MIN(first_name), e_id, COUNT(t_id)
	FROM Employees NATURAL JOIN Transactions
	GROUP BY e_id;
	```
	
	This works as each `e_id` will have on associated `first_name`, taking the `MIN` will return the only entry.
	{:.info}
	
These both give the following output where the `first_name` included too:

| first_name | e_id | COUNT(t_id) |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| Anne | 1 | 2 |
| William | 3 | 1 |

#### Intuitive Method
Intuitively `GROUP BY` works like this:

1. Do the previous part of the query until `GROUP BY` (except ignoring the part in `SELECT`)
1. Split the resulting table into sub-tables:
	1. One sub-table for each value of the variables in `GROUP BY`. (If you  had `first_name` and `e_id`, yo would have a sub-tale for each pair of `first_name` and `e_id`).
	
		This means that if you had two employees called Anne you would have two sub-tables, one for each Anne, identified by their `e_id`.
		{:.info}
		
This means that for the following query you would get the following table (prior to `SELECT`ing the required rows):

```sql
...
FROM Employees NATURAL JOIN Transactions
GROUP BY first_name, e_id;
```

| first_name | e_id | sub-table(birthday) | sub-table(family_name) | sub-table(c_id) | sub-table(t_id) |
| :-- | --: | :-- | :-- | --: | --: |
| Anne | 1 | 1990-11-10 | Smith | 3 | 1 |
| " | "| 1990-11-10 | Smith | 6 | 2 |
| William | 3 | 1995-05-09 | Taylor | 19 | 3 |

As the table is grouped by the `first_name` and `e_id` these are pulled out of the table and redundant rows are removed. Aggregates are then calculated on the sub-tables of each group.
{:.info}

### `Having`
This is just `WHERE` but done after a `GROUP BY`. This means that it doesn't affect `GROUP BY` and can be used on aggregates on the sub-tables in its expressions.

For the following query:

```sql
SELECT first_name,e_id,COUNT(t_id)
FROM Employees NATURAL JOIN Transactions
GROUP BY first_name, e_id
HAVING MIN(c_id)<5;
```
you would get the following output:

| first_name | e_id | COUNT(t_id) |
| :-- | --: | --:
| Anne | 1 | 2 |

This is for the same table as used on [`GROUP BY`](#group-by).
{:.info}

### `ORDER BY`
This defines how the output is sorted:

```sql
SELECT first_name
FROM Employees
ORDER BY family_name;
```

| first_name |
| :-- |
| David |
| Anne |
| William |

You can also have more than one attribute in `ORDER BY`. Then it would order those attributes in order.
{:.info}

It defaults to **ascending** order. You can also do descending by writing `DESC` after the attribute you want to sort.
