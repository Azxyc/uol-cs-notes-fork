## Order of Execution
SQL queries have the following order of execution:

```
6. SELECT
1. FROM
2. WHERE
3. GROUP BY
4. HAVING
5. ORDER BY
```

## Views
Views are saved queries that you can use as virtual tables.

Consider the following tables:

* Employees
	
	| birthday | first_name | family_name | e_id |
	| :-- | :-- | :-- | --: |
	| 1990-11-10 | Anne | Smith | 1 |
	| 2000-02-05 | David | Jones | 2 |
	| 1995-05-09 | William | Taylor | 3 |
	
* Transactions 

	| t_id | c_id | e_id |
	| --: | --: | --: |
	| 1 | 3 | 1 |
	| 2 | 6 | 1 |
	| 3 | 19 | 3 |

Say we completed a complex query and we want to save it. We can add a line to the query for the table to be saved as a `VIEW`:

```sql
CREATE VIEW Employee_transaction_count AS
SELECT first_name, e_id, COUNT(t_id)
FROM Employees NATURAL JOIN Transactions
GROUP BY first_name, e_id;
```

This would save the following `VIEW`:

* Employee_transaction_count
	
	| first_name | e_id | COUNT(t_id) |
	| :-- | --: | --: |
	| Anne | 1 | 2 |
	| William | 3 | 1 |
	
### Views as Virtual Tables
To query a `VIEW` you would do it like any other query:

```sql
SELECT first_name, COUNT(t_id)
FROM Employee_transaction_count;
```

This would create the following result:

| first_name | COUNT(t_id)
| :-- | --: |
| Anne | 2 |
| William | 1 |

### Restrictions of Views

* Data in views **can't** be modified.
	* Entries can't be updated, deleted from or inserted to conventionally.
	* Triggers can do this but this is not covered in this module.
* Views can be replaced with updated versions:

	```sql
	CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Employee_transaction_count AS
	SELECT first_name, COUNT(t_id)
	FROM Employees NATURAL JOIN Transactions
	GROUP BY first_name, e_id;
	```
* Views can be removed:
	
	```sql
	DROP VIEW Employee_transaction_count;
	```

## Relational Algebra
This is mathematics over a relational set of tables. As it is in a table you use set semantics as there is no order and no duplicates.

This is very important for **optimisation**.

### Projection ($\pi$)

$\pi_\text{attribute list}(R)=$ restricts $R$ to attributes in the **attribute list**.

As an example we can have the following expression:

$$
\pi_\text{family_name,birthday} (\text{Employees})
$$

This would produce the following output:

| family_name | birthday |
| :-- | :-- |
| Smith | 1990-11-10 |
| Jones | 2000-02-05 |
| Taylor | 1995-05-09 |

This is the same as the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT family_name, birthday
FROM Employees;
```

We are using `DISTINCT` due to the set semantics of the expression.

### Renaming ($\rho$)

$\rho_{A1\rightarrow B1,A2\rightarrow B2,\ldots}=$ renames attribute $A1$ to $B1$, attribute $A2$ to $B2$ and so on.

As an example we can have the following expression:

$$
\rho_\text{birthday}\rightarrow\text{bday}(\text{Employees})
$$


 This would give the following table:

| bday       | first_name | family_name |
| :--------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| 1990-11-19 | Anne       | Smith       |
| 2000-02-05 | David      | Jones       |
| 1995-05-09 | William    | Taylor      |

This is the same as the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT birthday AS bdday,first_name,family_name
FROM Employees;
```

### Selection ($\sigma$)

$\sigma_\text{condition}(R) =$ set of all tuples in $R$ that satisfy the **condition**.

As an example we can have the following expression:

$$
\sigma_\text{first_name='Anne'}(\text{Employees})
$$

Which gives the following table:

| birthday   | first_name | family_name |
| :--------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1990-11-10 | Anne       | Smith       |

This is the same as the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM Employees
WHERE first_name='Anne';
```

In SQL you should remember that you select using the `WHERE` keyword.{:.info}

### Cartesian Product ($\times$)

$R_1\times R_2=$ pairs each tuple in $R_1$ with each tuple in $R_2$.

Consider the following tables:

* Modules

	| code    | year |  sem |
	| :------ | ---: | ---: |
	| COMP105 |    1 |    1 |
	| COMP201 |    2 |    1 |

* Lecturers

	| name      | module  |
	| --------- | ------- |
	| John      | COMP105 |
	| Sebastian | COMP201 |

An example relational algebra expression could be:

$$
\text{Modules}\times\text{Lecturers}
$$

Which gives the following table:

| code    | year | sem  | name      | module  |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | --------- | ------- |
| COMP105 | 1    | 1    | John      | COMP105 |
| COMP105 | 1    | 1    | Sebastian | COMP201 |
| COMP201 | 2    | 1    | John      | COMP105 |
| COMP201 | 2    | 1    | Sebastian | COMP201 |

This is the same as the following query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM Modules, Lecturers;
```

### Natural Join ($\bowtie$)

$R_1\bowtie R_2=$ pairs of each tuple in $R_1$ with each tuple in $R_2$ with matching common attributes.

As an example we could have the following expression:

$$
\text{Employees}\bowtie\text{Transactions}
$$

This would give the following table:

| birthday   | first_name | family_name | e_id | t_id | c_id |
| :--------- | :--------- | :---------- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1990-11-10 | Anne       | Smith       |    1 |    1 |    3 |
| 1990-11-10 | Anne       | Smith       |    1 |    2 |    6 |
| 1995-05-09 | William    | Taylor      |    3 |    3 |   19 |

This is the same as the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM Employees NATURAL JOIN
Transactions;
```

### Additional Functions

1. Left/right semi-join ($\ltimes/\rtimes)$ - Returns the rows from the left/right table that would be matched to a row on the other side in a natural join.
1. `GROUP BY` - This function is part of relational algebra but is complex to define. 

See [SQL Queries (Optional Part)]({{site.baseurl}}/comp207#group-by) for additional examples of semi-join and `GROUP BY`.

### Combined Example

With the following schema:

```
R(a,b)
S(c,d)
T(e,z)
```

Consider the following relational algebra example:

$$
\rho_{a\rightarrow z}(R\times S)\bowtie T
$$

You could write this in the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT a AS z, b c, d
      FROM (SELECT *
            FROM R, S)) NATURAL JOIN T;
```
