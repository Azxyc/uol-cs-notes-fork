We can perform **faster joins** provided that the tables are **sorted** or **indexed**. In order to sort the data quickly we can do this **inside of memory**, instead of on the disk.

## Merge Sort

```
Divide input in two parts P1, P2
Sort P1 & P2 recursively
While P1 or P2 is not empty:
	Add smallest remaining element from P1 or P2 to output
```

### External Memory Merge Sort

```
Divide input in M parts P1, P2, ..., PM
Sort P1, P2, ..., PM recursively
While not all Pi are empty:
	Add smallest remaining element from any part Pi to output
```

* $M$ is the number of disk blocks that fit in RAM

Additionally, the following are true:

* The RAM holds the smallest blocks from each part.
* On each level or recursion we scan through all blocks once ($O(\frac NB)$) disk operation where $B$ is the block size.
* We split in M buckets in each level or recursion until the remainder is below MB (where it fits in RAM and can be sorted directly): $\log_M(\frac M {MB})$ levels.
* The total number of disk operations is $O(\frac N {B\log_M(\frac N {MB})})$

#### Comparison
In practice, since hard disks are slow, the running time is mostly spent on disk operations. Therefore, the standard running time is:

$$
O(\frac N {B\log_M(\frac N {MB})})
$$

where $D$ is the time of a disk operation.

Quick-sort (and other internal memory sorting algorithms) use the following order of time:

$$
O(\frac N {B\log_2(N)\times D})
$$

External memory sorting is much faster on inputs that are much larger than main memory.
