Selection can be performed faster if we know where to find the rows that are being selected. One way of doing this is by using indexes.

## Index
Given the values for one or more attributes of a relation $R$, provides quick access to the tuples with these values.

Consider that we have the following data that we want to index:

* Students
	
	| id | name | programme |
	| --: | :-- | :-- |
	| 1234 | Anna | G401 |
	| 2345 | Ben | G701 |
	| 3456 | Chloe | G401 |
	| 4567 | Dave | G401 |
	
We can use the following index table, sorted by `value`:

| value | pointers to rows |
| :-- | :-- |
| G401 | 1234, 3456, 4567 |
| G701 | 2435 |

You should have an index for each attribute that you want to select.
{:.info}

There are two different **types** of index:

* **Secondary** - Only points to the location of records on disk.
	
	Always dense.
	{:.info}
* **Primary** - In addition, defines how data is sorted on disk.

	Good when attributes involve primary keys.
	{:.info}
	
### Using indexes
To complete a selection using an index:

1. Find the entry that you are selecting in the index (G401).
1. Visit all rows in `Students` whose ids occur in the index entry for G401.

This has a running time of:

$$
O(\log d+\text{size of output})
$$

#### Forms of Indexes
You can use the following datatypes as indexes:

* **Hash-Index** - Good for equality.
* **B+- Tree** - Good for ranges.

You can create an index in SQL using the following command:

```sql
CREATE INDEX
	ON Students USING btree -- default, can use hash
	(programme, year); -- the columns that you want to index
```
