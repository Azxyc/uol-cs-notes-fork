title: COMP207 - Searching & Inserting in B+ Trees
tags: COMP207 Lectures

There is a visualisation tool for B+ trees available at [https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BPlusTree.html](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BPlusTree.html).

## Single vs Multi-Level Indexes

* Single Level Index - Stores in a single list.
* Multi-Level Index - Distributes across different layers.

## B+ Tree Leaves (Idea)

| $a_1$ | $a_2$ | $\ldots$ | $a_n$ | |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Points to tuples with value $a_1$. | Points to tuples with value $a_2$ | | Points to tuples with value $a_n$. | Next Leaf |

$n$ is chosen such that a node fits into a single disk block:

* Disk Block Size - 512 byte
* Values - 4 byte integers
* Pointers - 8 bytes

With the above example $n=42$ as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
512&\geq42(8+2)+8\\
512&<43(8+4)+8
\end{aligned}
$$

## B+ Tree Inner Nodes (Idea)

| $a_1$ | $a_2$ | $\ldots$ | $a_n$ | |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Points to a nodes for values $<a_1$. | Points to nodes for values $\geq a_1$ and $<a_2$ | | Points to nodes for values $\geq a_{n-1}$ and $<a_n$ | Points to node for values $\geq a_n$ |

Pointers point to B+ tree nodes at the level below. $n$ is chosen as before.

## B+ Tree Leaves (Actually)

* Not all the fields have to be used.
* Fields are filled from left to right.

| $a_1$ | $a_2$ | $\ldots$ | $a_i$ | Unused | Unused |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Points to tuples with value $a_1$. | Points to tuples with value $a_2$ | | Points to tuples with value $a_u$. | Points Nowhere | Next Leaf |

Ensure that at least $\lfloor \frac{n+1}2\rfloor$ pointers are used (unless this is the only leaf).

To follow with the online tool, we count the next leaf pointer as a pointer, even if there is none.

## B+ Tree Nodes (Actually)

* Not all the fields have to be used.
* Fields are filled from left to right.

| $a_1$ | $a_2$ | $\ldots$ | $a_i$ | Unused | Unused | 
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Points to a nodes for values $<a_1$. | Points to nodes for values $\geq a_1$ and $<a_2$ | | Points to nodes for values $\geq a_{i-1}$ and $<a_i$ | Points to node for values $\geq a_i$ | Points Nowhere |


Where:

* $a_i$ - Number is smallest number in child-sub-tree slightly to the right.

Ensure that at least $\lceil \frac{n+1}2\rceil$ pointers are used (the root must use $\geq 2$ pointers).

## B+ Tree Index
A B+ tree index of the prime numbers through 47 looks like the following:

### Searching Values
To find the pointer to the rows with value $v$:

1. Start at the root of the B+ tree.
1. While the current node is a non-leaf node:
	* f $v<a_1$, proceed to the first child of the node.
	* Otherwise find the largest $i$ with $a_i\geq v$ and proceed to the associated child node.
1. If the current node is a leaf:
	* If $v$ occurs in the leaf, follow the associated pointer.
	* If $v$ does not occur in the leaf, return "$v$ doesn't exist in the index".
	
The running time is:

$$
O(h\times\log_2n)
$$

where $h$ is the height of the B+ tree. 

The **real** running time is:

$$
O(h\times D)
$$

where $D$ is the time for a disk operation.

### Inserting Values
To insert a new value/pointer pair:

1. Find the leaf that should contain the value.
1. If the leaf is not full, insert the key value pair at a suitable location.
1. If the leaf is full:
	1. Split the leaf to make space for the new value/pointer pair and move half of the pointers to the new node.
	1. Insert the value/pointer pair
	1. Connect the leaf to a suitable parent node (which might incur the creation of a new node).

The running time is:

$$
O(h\times\log_2n)
$$

where $h$ is the height of the B+ tree. 

The **real** running time is:

$$
O(h\times D)
$$

where $D$ is the time for a disk operation.
