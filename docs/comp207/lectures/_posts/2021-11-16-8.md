title: Optimising Query Plans
tags: COMP207 Lectures

The initial query plan, generated from a query, may not be the optimal one. We can complete the following to make it run faster.

## How to Optimise
Queries are evaluated from the **bottom up** therefore:

* Efficiency depends on the size of intermediate results.

We should rewrite the initial query plan so that intermediate results are as **small as possible**.

We can use **relational algebra equivalence laws** to make query plans with smaller intermediate results.

## Heuristics

1. Push selections as far down the tree as possible.
	
	```mermaid
	flowchart LR
	subgraph inefficient
	11["π depart, name"] --> 12[σ worksAt=depart] --> 13["⨉"] --> 14[Stores] & 15[Emplyees]
	end
	subgraph better
	21["π depart, name"] --> 22[σ worksAt=depart AND city=Liv] --> 23["⨉"] --> 24[σ city=Liv] & 25[Emplyees]
	24 --> Stores
	end
	inefficient --> better
	```
	
	This gets rid of many irrelevant tuples very early during execution.

1. Push projections as far down the tree as possible, or insert projections where appropriate.

	```mermaid
	flowchart LR
	subgraph inefficient
	11["π depart, name"] --> 12[σ worksAt=depart AND city=Liv] --> 13["⨉"] --> 14[σ city=Liv] & 15[Emplyees]
	14 --> 16[Stores]
	end
	subgraph better
	21["π depart, name"] --> 22[σ worksAt=depart AND city=Liv] --> 23["⨉"] --> 24[π worksAt] & 25[π depart, name]
	24 --> 26[σ city=Liv]
	26 --> 27[Stores]
	25 --> 28[Emplyees]
	end
	inefficient --> better
	```
1. If possible, introduct equijoins for $\times$ followed by $\sigma$.
	
	```mermaid
	flowchart LR
	subgraph inefficient
	11["π depart, name"] --> 12[σ worksAt=depart AND city=Liv] --> 13["⨉"] --> 14[π worksAt] & 15[π depart, name]
	14 --> 16[σ city=Liv]
	16 --> 17[Stores]
	15 --> 18[Emplyees]
	end
	subgraph better
	21["π depart, name"] --> 23["⋈ worksAt=depart"] --> 24[π worksAt] & 25[π depart, name]
	24 --> 26[σ city=Liv]
	26 --> 27[Stores]
	25 --> 28[Emplyees]
	end
	inefficient --> better
	```
	
	$\bowtie$ is faster than a $\times$ followed by a $\sigma$.

There are also many more heuristics that can be used to optimise the query plan.
