## XML
XML files look similar to HTML files. This is an XML document representing the graph from last lecture:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes" ?>
<lecturers>
	<lecturer>
		<name>J. Fearnley</name>
		<phone>7954…</phone>
		<teaches>
			<code>COMP105</code>
			<title>Progr. Paradigms</code>
		</teaches>
		<memberOf>Economics & …</memberOf>
	</lecturer>
	...
</lecturers>
```

There are the following structures:

* **Tags** - Enclosed between `<>`.
	* Open with `<...>`.
	* Close with `</...>`.
* **Element** - The opening, closing tags and all data in-between.
* **Attributes**:
	* Elements can have attributes (name/value pairs), which are put into the element's opening tag:
	
		```xml
		<lecturer name="J. Fearnley">
			<module code=”COMP105” title=“Programming Paradigms” />
		</lecturer>
		```
	* Sub-elements should be used if there is a one to many relationship.
		
### Nodes with Multiple Parents
These don't exist in XML:

* There is a notion of references like symbolic links in a file-system.

### Other Features

* There can be an optional **document type definition** or **XML schema** at the start of the XML document.
* **Entity References** - Can serve as shortcuts to often repeated text or to distinguish reserved characters from content.
* **Comments** - Enclosed in `<!-- ... -->` tags.
* **CDATA** - These are processing instructions that can be used to provide information to the application.
