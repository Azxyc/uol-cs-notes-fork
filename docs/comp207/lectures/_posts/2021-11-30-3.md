XPath allows us to write queries that return a set of value or nodes from an XML document:

* Values
* Nodes
	* Document Node
		* The whole document.
	* Element Node
		* Includes the root.
	* Attributes
		* Inside the tags of elements.

## Path Expressions
They take the following format:

$$
/E_1/E_2/E_3/\ldots/E_n
$$

This would select **all** nodes reachable from the root by following the edges in the order of the path.

The result is returned in the document order.

## Relative Path Expressions
You can miss out the first slash to evaluate relative to another node.

## Attributes
The path expressions can be extended so that we can return attribute values:

```
/students/student/@name
```

## Wildcards
A wildcard `*` represents any tag name or attribute name:

```
/students/student/module/@*
```

This would return all attributes of the `module` elements.
