## General Form
XPaths generally take the following form:

```
/axis1::E1[C1]/axis2::E2[C2]
```

* `axis` are navigation axes.
* `C` are conditions.
* `E` are name or a tag, attribute or `*`. 

## Navigation Axes

| Axis | Shorthand |  Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `attribute` | `@` | An attribute |
| `child` | Default (`child::` can be omitted) | Any child |
| `descendant` | `//E` instead of `/descendant::E` | Any proper descendant |
| `descendant-or-self` | | Any descendant |
| `ancestor` | | Any proper ancestor |
| `following-sibling` | | Any sibling to the right |
| `preceding-sibling` | | Any sibling to the left |
| `parent` | `..` | The parent |
| `self` | `.` | Yourself |

A **proper** descendant or ancestor is at least one node away (not self).

## Conditions
The idea is the if the condition is true, follow the path further.

* You can use comparitors like `=`, `!=` and `>=`.
	* A value can be a relative path expression or any constant.
* You can combine by using `and` and `or`.

```
//book[category="CS"]/title
```

You can also write `E[i]` which is true if the current node is the `i`-th child of its parent:

```
//*[category="CS" or category="Scifi"][1]
```

This would return the first item in "CS" or "Scifi.

You can also use functions like:

* `last()`

in place of `i`.

### Boolean Conversions
We can also include additional XPaths and strings in the condition:

* Returns the titles of all book that have a category:

	```
	//book[category]/title
	```
* Returns the books if the price attribute is non-empty:

	```
	//book[@price/data()]
	```
