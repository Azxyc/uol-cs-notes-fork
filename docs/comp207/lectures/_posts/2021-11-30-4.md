## General Form
XPaths generally take the following form:

```
/axis1::E1[C1]/axis2::E2[C2]
```

* `axis` are navigation axes.
* `C` are conditions.
* `E` are name or a tag, attribute or `*`. 

## Navigation Axies

| Axis | Shorthand |  Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `attribute` | `@` | An attribute |
| `child` | Default (`child::` can be ommitted) | Any child |
| `descendant` | `//E` instead of `/descendant::E` | Any proper descendant |
| `descendant-or-self` | | Any descendant |
| `ancestor` | | Any proper ancestor |
| `following-sibling` | | Any sibling to the right |
| `preceding-sibling` | | Any sibling to the left |
| `parent` | `..` | The parent |
| `self` | `.` | Yourself |

A **proper** descendant or ancestor is at least one node away (not self).

## Conditions
The idea is the if the condition is true, follow the path further.

* You can use comparitors like `=`, `!=` and `>=`.
	* A value can be a relative path expression or any constant.
* You can combine by using `and` and `or`.
