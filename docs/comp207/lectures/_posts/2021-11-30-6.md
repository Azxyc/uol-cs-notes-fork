## Order By
This clause is included in the following order:

| Clause | Requirement |
| :-- | :-- |
| `for` & `let` | Any number, interleaved.<br>Some interpreters require at least one `let`. |
| `where` | Optional |
| `order by` | Optional |
| `return` | Mandatory |

and we can use it like so:

```
let $doc := doc("mydoc.xml")
for $b in $doc/books/book
for $author in $b/author
order by $author descending
return <pair>{$b/title}, {$author}</pair>
```

## Group By 
This clause is interted in the following order:

| Clause | Requirement |
| :-- | :-- |
| `for` & `let` | Any number, interleaved.<br>Some interpreters require at least one `let`. |
| `where` | Optional |
| `group by` | Optional |
| `order by` | Optional |
| `return` | Mandatory |

and we can use it like so:

```
let $doc := doc("mydoc.xml")
for $m in $doc/university/student/module
group by $mod:=$m
return <pair>{$mod}, {count($m)}</pair>
```

We can only aggregate by variables that are grouped (in this case only `$m` not `$m/...`).

Other aggregate functions include:

* `min()`
* `max()`
* `avg()`
* `sum()`

## Distinct-Values
This converts the enclosed elements to strings, and filters so that they are distinct.

We can use it on each element `$m` in the for loop individually:

```
let $doc := doc("mydoc.xml")
for $m in $doc/university/student/module
return distinct-values($m)
```

This only removes duplicate module elements per-student.

or we can use it on the whole result:

```
distinct-values(let $doc := doc("mydoc.xml")
for $m in $doc/university/student/module
return $m)
```
