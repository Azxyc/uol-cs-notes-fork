We can convert the other way by using [XML Schema]({{site.baseurl}}/comp207/lectures/2021/11/30/2.html).

To convert an XML database to SQL we have the following approaches:

## Storing XML in an Attribute
We can use the XML data type (`XML` or `XMLType`) to store raw XML in a serialised form.

### Creating Tables Using XML Type
We can use the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE XMLStaff (
	docNo CHAR(4),
	docDate DATE,
	staffData XML
);
INSERT INTO XMLStaff VALUES (
	'D001',
	'2004-12-01',
	XML('
		<STAFF branchNo = "B005">
		<STAFFNO>SL21</STAFFNO>
		<POSITION>Manager</POSITION>
		<DOB>1945-10-01</DOB>
		<SALARY>30000</SALARY> </STAFF>
	')
);
```

## Schema-Independent Representation
This method allows us to store the XML as a tree inside of a table:

* This creates the issue of making the tree difficult to search.
	* To solve this we can use a **denormalised index** in a second table that links nodes and their parents.

From this we then get the following schema-independent table:

| nodeID | nodeType | nodeName | nodeData | parentID | rootID |
| --: | :-- | :-- | :-- | --: | --: |
| 0 | Document | STAFFLIST | | | 0 |
| 1 | Element | STAFFLIST | | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | Element | STAFF | | 1 | 0 |
| 3 | Element | STAFFNO | | 2 | 0 |
| 4 | Text | | SL21 | 3 | 0 |
| 5 | Element | NAME | | 2 | 0 |
| 6 | Element | FNAME | | 5 | 0 |
| 7 | Text | | John | 6 | 0 |
| 8 | Element | LNAME | | 5 | 0 |
| 9 | Text | | White | 8 | 0 |

and it's **denormalised index**:

| path | nodeID | parentID |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| /STAFFLIST | 1 | 0 |
| STAFFLIST | 1 | 0 |
| STAFFLIST/STAFF | 2 | 1 | 
| STAFF | 2 | 1 |
| /STAFFLIST/STAFF/NAME | 5 | 2 |
| STAFFLIST/STAFF/NAME | 5 | 2 |
| STAFF/NAME | 5 | 2 | 
| NAME | 5 | 2 |

## Storing XML in Shredded Form

* XML is decomposed into its constituent element and data distributed over a number of attributes in one or more relations.
* Storing shredded document may make it easier to index values of some element, provided these element are placed into their own attributes.
* Also possible to add some additional data relation to hierarchical nature of the XML, making it possible to recompose the original structure and ordering. 
	* This allows the XML to be updated.

With this approach we also have to create an appropriate database structure.
