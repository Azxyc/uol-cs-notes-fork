## Document Stores
This is a database that stores an `ObjectID` associated in a document (typically in JSON).

### JSON vs XML
We can represent the following XML:

```xml
<?xml version=“1.0” standalone=“yes”>
<students>
	<student>
		<name>Anna</name>
		<number>20171989</number>
		<programme>G402</programme>
	</student>
	<student>
		<name>John</name>
		<number>20174378</number>
		<programme>G702</programme>
	</student>
	…
</students>
```

as the following JSON file:

```json
{"students":[
	{"name": "Anna",
	"number":20171989,
	"programme":"G402"},
	{"name": "John",
	"number":20174378,
	"programme":"G702"},
	…
]}
```

* `{}` are used for **objects**.
* `[]` are used for **arrays**.

### MongoDB
This DBMS stores documents in a variant of JSON:

* Creating/managing collections:
	
	```
	dc.createCollection("students")
	```
* Insert/update/delete documents:
	
	```
	db.students.insert{
		{name: "Anna", studentID: 20171989, year: 2}
	}
	```
* Finding documents:
	
	```
	db.students.find({year: 2})
	db.students.find({year: {$lt: 3}}).sort({year:1})
	```

#### MongoDB Properties
**Sharding** (horizontal fragmentation):

* Collections are split into **horizontal fragments**.
* Based on the **shard key**:
	* Indexed Field
	* Exists in all documents.
	
**Replication**:

* Horizontal fragments of collections are replicated.
* Master-slave approach:
	* Primary copy (master) and secondary copies (replicas).
	* **Updates** - On master, then delegated to replicas.
	* **Reads** - Delegated to master (default) or to any replica.
	
**Transaction Support**:

* ACID is supported on the newest version from 2020.
* Isolation is not fully supported as only snapshots are completed.

## Column Stores
Column stores are laid out like so:

* Student:
	
	| | name | | contact | | | |
	| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
	| | first | last | address | city | postcode | email|
	| 123 | Anna | Collins | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
	
The following are different to normal tables:

* **Column Family** - A group of column qualifiers.
	* **Column Qualifier** - Conventional columns.
	
	These are referenced as `<columnfamiliy>:<columnqualifier>`.
	{:.info}

### Hbase
This column store implementation uses the hadoop distributed file system:

* Creating tables:
	
	```
	create 'STUDENT','NAME','Grade','Programme'
	```
* Inserting rows:
	
	```
	put 'STUDENT','row1','Name:Fname','Anna'
	put 'STUDENT','row1','Grade:COMP207','100'
	```
* Finding documents:

	```
	get 'STUDENT','row1'
	scan 'STUDENT'
	```
	
	`scan` is used for going through the whole table.
	{:.info}

#### Hbase Properties
Hbase uses two levels of fragmentation:

* **Top Level** - Rows are divided into regions (ranges of rows).
* **Bottom Level** - Regions store different column families in different nodes (computers).

There is no transaction support.

Each item has a time stamp and one can access past version of the database (if setup):

```
> get ’STUDENT’, ‘row1’
	COLUMN	CELL
	name:first	timestamp=1511139129384, value=Anna
	name:last	timestamp=1511139140333, value=…
```

## Graph Databases
These store data as a graph with:

* Objects and attributes on the nodes.
* Relations on the arcs.

Data is then accessed using an SQL-like path query language.
