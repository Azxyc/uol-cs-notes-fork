This is a more general form of OLAP. They refer to the discovery of **patterns** or **knowledge in data**

## Applications of Data-Mining

* **Deviation Detection** - Identifying anomalies such as intruders.
* **Link Analysis** - Trying the discover links between attributes.
	* These can be used to make association rules.
* **Predictive Modelling** - Trying to predict future behaviour of certain attributes in the data base on pas behaviour.
* **Database Segmentation** - Grouping data by similar behaviour.
	* Group customers based on spending habits.
	* Group customers based on reaction of a marketing campaign.
	
## Types of Discovered Knowledge

* **Association Rules**:
	* People who buy nappies buy beer.
* **Classification Hierarchies**:
	* Classification of mutual funds based on performance data characteristics such as growth, income and stability.
* **Sequential Patterns**:
	* If a patient underwent cardiac bypass surgery for blocked arteries and an aneurysm and later developed high blood urea within a year of surgery, they is likely to suffer from kidney failure within the next 18 months.
* **Clustering**:
	* Group treatment data on a disease based on similarity of side effects.
