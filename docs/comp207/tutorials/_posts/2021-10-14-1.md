This tutorial wasn't that great. It would be much better if this was on a live database so I've got no idea if any of these are actually right.

## Part 1

1. Average grade:

	```sql
	SELECT AVG(grade) 
		FROM Enrolment
		WHERE s_id=1;
	```
1. Years of COMP207 teaching:

	```sql
	SELECT COUNT(year) 
		FROM CoursesInYear 
		WHERE code='COMP207';
	```
1. Students in COMP207 in 2021:

	```sql
	SELECT COUNT(s_id) 
		FROM Enrolment 
		WHERE code='COMP207' AND year='2021';
	```
	
### Simple Joins

1. Lecturers teach me, sorted by birthday:

	```sql
	SELECT DISTINCT first_name, last_name 
		FROM Lecturers L, CoursesInYear CIY, Enrolment E
		WHERE E.code = CIY.code AND CIY.l_id = L.l_id AND E.s_id = 1 
		SORT BY L.birthday;
	```
1. Names of courses you attend, sorted by name:

	```sql
	SELECT name
		FROM Enrollment E, Courses C
		Where e.code=c.code
		ORDER BY name;
	```
1. Names of courses Rasmus Ibsen-Jensen has taught:
	
	```sql	
	SELECT DISTINCT name
		from CourseesInYear ciy, Lecturers l, Courses c
		WHERE ciy.code=c.cody AND l.l_id=ciy.L_id
		AND first_name='Rasmus' AND Last_name='Ibsen-Jensen'
		ORDER BY c.code;
	```
	
### Unions

1. What names of students, lecturers and courses exist:

	```sql
	SELECT first_name AS name
		FROM Students
		UNION
		SELECT first_name AS name
		FROM Lecturers
		UNION
		SELECT name AS name
		FROM Courses
	```
1. List all lecturers and students ordered by first name and last name:

	```
	SELECT first_name, last_name
		FROM Students
		UNION
		SELECT first_name, last_name
		FROM Lecturers
		ORDER BY first_name, last_name;
	```
