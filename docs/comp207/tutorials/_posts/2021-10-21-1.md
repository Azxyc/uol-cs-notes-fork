## Question 1
The short hand notation would be:

$$
S_a: r_1(X);w_1(X);c_1;r_2(X);w_2(X);c_2;
$$

The schedule is a **serial** schedule as the transactions are run one after the other.

The following ACID properties are broken:

* No ACID properties are broken as there are no writes to the databases mid transaction.

## Question 2
1. This breaks:
	* Atomicity as $T_1$ is not complete.
	* Maybe consistency if strong consistency is used.
	* Isolation as the transaction is not serialisable.
	* Durability breaks as $T_1$ is not complete.

1. If $T_1$ is rolled back then the database is left in an inconsistent state due to writes caused by $T_2$.
1. If we rolled both transactions back then durability is broken as we change the data **committed** by $T_2$.

## Question 3
* $S_3$:
	
	```mermaid
	graph LR
	T3 --> T1
	T2 --> T3
	T2 --> T1
	```
	
	No cycles so it is conflict-serialisable.
* $S_4$:
	
	```mermaid
	graph LR
	T3 --> T1
	T2 --> T3 & T1
	T1 --> T3
	```
	
	There is a cycle between $T_3$ and $T_1$ so it is not conflict-serialisable.
	
## Question 4
A transaction can't be in conflict with itself. Therefore a cycle but be between two transactions and therefore be greater than 1.
