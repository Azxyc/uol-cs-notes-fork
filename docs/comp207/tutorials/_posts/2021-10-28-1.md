## Locks

See the answers for tutorial 4 for this question.
	
## Logging & Recovery
1. Recovery with undo-logging:
	1.  Change the value of $X$ on disk back to 10 and call abort for $T_1$ and $T_2$.
	1. Change:
		* $Z=30$
		* $X=10$
		
		on disk and call abort for $T_1$.
	1. Same as *2* but also change:
	
		* $V=50$
	1. No change all transactions completed successfully.

1. Values on disk:
	1. $X$ might be on disk.
	1. All values from $T_2$ must be on disk and $X$ and $Z$ might be on disk from $T_1$.
	1. All values from $T_2$ must be on disk and $X$, $V$ and $Z$ might be on disk from $T_1$.
	1. All values must be on disk.
1. For the schedules in the tutorial:
	1. The following transactions need to be rolled back:
		* $S_1$ - $T_3$
		* $S_2$ - $T_2$
		* $S_3$ - None
		* $S_4$ - $T_3$
		
		You should roll back any transactions with **dirty reads**. You should also roll back any other transaction that reads a write created by a transaction that has had a dirty read.
		
		Dirty reads are where a transaction is allowed to read a row that has been modified by an another transaction which is not committed yet.
