## Delay
There are several types of delay that a packet can experience:

* Nodal Processing ($d_\text{proc}$)
	* Checking for bit errors.
	* Determining the output link.
	* Generally < 1 ms
* Queuing Delay
	* Time waiting at output link for transmission.
	* Depends on the congestion level of the router.
* Transmission Delay
	
	$$d_\text{trans}=\frac L R$$
	
	* $L$ - Packet length in bits.
	* $R$ - Link transmission rate in bps.
* Propagation Delay
		
	$$d_\text{prop}=\frac d s$$
	
	* $d$ - The length of the physical link.
	* $s$ - The propagation speed on the physical media ($~2\times 10^8$ ms).

This comes together to give the total packet delay of:

$$d_\text{nodal} = d_\text{proc} +d_\text{queue} +d_\text{trans} +d_{prop}$$

### Traffic Intensity
This is calculated using the following equation:

$$\text{Traffic Intensity}=\frac{La} r$$

* $R$ - Link bandwidth in bps.
* $L$ - Packet length in bits.
* $a$ - Average packet arrival rate.

Queuing delay increases exponentially with the traffic intensity.

For small values then the delay is small but if the delay is >1 then packets are dropped.

### `traceroute`
This is a program that can measure the delay to all the 'hops' on a packet's journey.

## Throughput
**Throughput** is the rate at which bits are being sent from sender to receiver. This can be measured as:

* Instantaneous - Rate at a given point in time.
* Average - Rate over a longer period of time.

The throughput is limited by the slowest link on a packet's path.
