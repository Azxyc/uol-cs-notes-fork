title: COMP211 - Protocol Layers & Reference Models
tags: COMP211 Lectures

Defining protocol layers helps in dealing with complex systems:

* Explicit structure allows identification, relationship of complex systemâ€™s pieces.
	* Layered **reference model** for discussion.
* Modularisation eases maintenance, updating of system.
* Change in layer's service implementation is transparent to rest of system.

## ISO/OSI Reference Model
The OSI reference model also includes:

* Presentation - Allows the applications to interpret the meaning of data.
	* Encryption, compression, machine specific conventions.
* Session - Synchronisation, check-pointing and recovery of data exchange.

The internet stack is missing these layers. If they are need they must be implemented in the application.
