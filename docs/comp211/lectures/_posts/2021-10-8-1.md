After the header, and before the body, of the email there must be a blank line. This is **required** for the assignment.

```

## Java Sockets
To open a socket use the code:

```java
import java.net.*;
Socket socket = new Socket("ip.address", <port>);
```

### Reading Sockets
To read the socket you can use the following:

```java
import java.io.*
InputStream is = socket.getInputStream();
InputStreamReader isr = new InputStremReader(is);
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
```

The `BufferedReader` allows you to read the stream a line at a time.
{:.info}

To read the buffer to a variable you can use the following:

```java
String response = br.readLine();
```

### Writing to Sockets
To send data you must first setup an output stream:

```java
DataOutputStram os = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());
```

To write a variable to the stream you use:

```java
os.writeBytes(variable);
```
