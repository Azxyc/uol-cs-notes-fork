## Demultiplexing
Each **IP datagram** carries the source and destination **IP address** and a **transport-layer segment**. This segment includes:

* Source Port
* Destination Port
* Other Header Fields
* Application Data

### Connection-less Demultiplexing
This is used by **UDP**. To create a socket you can use the following Java code:

```java
DatagramSocket socketName = new DatagramSocket(12345);
```

IP/UDP datagrams with same destination port #, but different source IP addresses and/or source port numbers will be directed to same socket at receiving host.

### Connection-Oriented Demultiplexing
TCP socket is identified by a 4-tuple:

* Source IP Address
* Source Port Number
* Destination IP Address
* Destination Port Number

The receiver uses all four values (4-tuple) to direct the segment to the appropriate socket.

Server may support many simultaneous TCP sockets:

* Each socket is identified by its own 4-tuple.
* Each socket is associated with a different connecting client.

### Differences

* **UDP** - Demultiplexing using destination port number (only).
* **TCP** - Demultiplexing using 4-tuple: source and destination IP addresses, and port numbers.
