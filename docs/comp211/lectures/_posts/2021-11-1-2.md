These notes are low-effort, due to catching up in this module. See [the videos and slides](https://liverpool.instructure.com/courses/54299/pages/3-transport-layer?module_item_id=1178720) for more detail.

## Connection-Less Transport
This means that there is:

* No handshaking between sender, receiver.
* Each UDP segment handled independently of others.

This saves time, is simpler and gives a small header size.

## UDP Uses
UDP is used for the following:

* Streaming multimedia apps (loss tolerant, rate
sensitive).
* DNS
* SNMP
* HTTP/3

If reliable transfer needed over UDP (HTTP/3):

* Add needed reliability at application layer.
* Add congestion control at application layer.

## UDP Segment Header
A UDP segment is laid out like the following:

| Source Port | Destination Port |
| :-: | :-: |
| Length | Checksum |
| Payload | Payload |
| ... | |

The segment is 32 bits wide.

## Internet Checksum
Checksums are used to find flipped bits in transmission.

To calculate the internet checksum:

1. Treat the whole contents of the UDP segment as a sequence of 16-bit integers.
1. Complete a one's complement sum of the integers.
	
	Wraparound the carry-out to the beginning of the addition.
	{:.info}
1. Put the checksum value in the UDP checksum field.

This only adds weak protection against single bit flips.
