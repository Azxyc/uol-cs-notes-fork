These notes are low-effort, due to catching up in this module. See [the videos and slides](https://liverpool.instructure.com/courses/54299/pages/3-transport-layer?module_item_id=1178720) for more detail.

You may want a protocol that is tailored to a specific scenario such as:

* Long fat pipes (many in flight packets).
* Wireless networks (noisy links with high bandwidth).
* Long delay links (long RTT).
* Data centre networks (latency sensitive).
* Low priority TCP traffic.

To facilitate this you can implement transport-layer functions in the application layer, on top of UDP.

## QUIC - Quick UDP Internet Connections (HTTP/3)
This is an application layer protocol on top of UDP:

* Increases the performance of HTTP
* Uses a slimmed HTTP/2 protocol and QUIC instead of TLS.

This protocol has the following features:

* **Error and Congestion Control** - Similar to TCP
* **Connection Establishment** - Reliability, congestion control, authentication, encryption and state all in one RTT.
	* Normally there would be two handshakes, one for TCP and one for TLS. 
* Multiple application-level streams can be multiplexed over a single QUIC connection.
