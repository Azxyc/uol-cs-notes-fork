## Sine Waves
Sine waves can be made using the following function:

$$
s(t)=A\sin(2\pi ft+\phi)
$$

Where:

* $A$ - Amplitude
* $f$ - Frequency
* $t$ - Time
* $\phi$ - Phase
* $T$ - Period ($\frac1f$)

Any signal can be made of many sine components.

### Frequency Domain Representation
* You can plot the frequencies of a **periodic** signal on a bar graph to represent the signal. (**Discrete**)
* **Aperiodic** signals have **continuous** frequency domain representations. 

If a signal has a spectrum with a zero frequency component (direct current), this is used as a voltage offset.

## Bandwidth
The bandwidth of a signal is the upper and lower limit of the frequencies that can be represented in the medium.

A higher bandwidth gives more definition to analogue signals.

## Advantages of Digital

* Digital is lower cost.
* Data integrity is preserved over longer distances with digital data.
	* Repeaters can amplify the data without including line noise.
* High degree of multiplexing is easier with digital techniques.
	* Increases utilisation.
* Data is easier to encrypt.
