## Attenuation
The received signal must be sufficiently higher than noise to be received without error.

* Signal amplitude decreases with distance.
* Depends on the medium.
* Attenuation is an increasing function of frequency. 

## Delay Distortion
This occurs as the velocity of propagation of a signal through a guided medium varies with frequency:

* Only in guided media.
* Propagation velocity varies with frequency.
	* Different parts of the spectrum arrive at different times.
	
## Noise
This is additional signals inserted between the transmitter and receiver. It could be due to:

* **Thermal**
	* Due to the thermal agitation of elections. 
	* Uniformly distributed
	* White noise.
* **Inter-modulation**
	* Signals that are the sum and difference of the original frequencies sharing a medium.
* **Cross-talk**
	* A signal from one line is picked up on another.
* **Impulse**
	* Irregular pulses or spikes caused by external electromagnetic interference.
	* Short Duration
	* High Amplitude
