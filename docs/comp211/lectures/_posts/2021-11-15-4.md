## Guided Transmission Media
In addition to the following you can also have transfer through **physical media**. This can give the best transfer rate (especially for large amounts of data).

* **Twisted Pair**
	* You can twist the cables more to give better cross talk.
* **Coaxial Cable** - A copper core surrounded by a mesh sheath.
* **Fibre Optics** - Light travels through a fibre via total internal reflection.

## Unguided Transmission Media
We can use various bandwidths of the electromagnetic spectrum to transmit data. Different frequency bands have different properties:

* **Radio Transmission**
	* In **VLF**, **LF** and **MF** bands radio waves follow the curvature of the earth.
	* The **HF** band can bounce off the ionosphere.
	
### Communication Satellites
Satellites in different height orbits have different communication properties:

| Height | Altitude (KM) | Orbit Type | Latency (ms) | Satellites Needed |
| :-- | --: | :-- | --: | --: |
| Geostationary | ~35000 | GEO | 270 | 3 |
| Medium Earth Orbit | 5000-15000 | MEO | 35-85 | 10 |
| Low Earth Orbit | ~0 | LEO | 1-7 | 50

Satellites operate on the following bands:

| Band | Down-link (GHz) | Up-link (GHz) | Bandwidth (MHz) | Problems |
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | :-- |
| L | 1.5 | 1.6 | 15 | Low bandwidth, Crowded |
| S | 1.9 | 2.2 | 70 | Low bandwidth, Crowded |
| C | 4 | 6 | 500 | Terrestrial Interference |
| Ku | 11 | 14 | 500 | Rain |
| Ka | 20 | 30 | 3500 | Rain, Equipment cost |
