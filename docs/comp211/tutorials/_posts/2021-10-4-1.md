## HTTP
There are two types of HTTP messages:

* `request`
* `response`

HTTP messages are encoded in ASCII. Here is one now:

```HTTP
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: comp211.gairing.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:92.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/92.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-GB
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
DNT: 1
Connection: keep-alive
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

Only the `GET` and `Host:` lines are required for a valid request.

* The top line is the request line. You can make requests such as `GET`, `POST` and `HEAD`.
* The rest of the lines are called the header lines. They specify certain parameters that the browser can set.

All lines end with a `\r\n` to indicate a carriage return and line feed. There is also an extra one at the end of the header lines.

### HTTP Request Message Format

```
<method> <URL> <version>\r\n	# request line
<header field name> <value>\r\n	# header lines
...
\r\n
<entity body>	# the requested body
```

### Other HTTP Request Messages
`POST` method:

* Web page often includes form input.
* User input sent from client to server in entity body of HTTP `POST` request message.

`GET` method (for sending data to server):

* Include user data in URL field of HTTP `GET` request message.
	
	This follows a `?` in the URL.
	{:.info}

`HEAD` method:

* Requests headers (only) that would be returned if specified URL were requested with an HTTP `GET` method.

`PUT` method:

* Uploads new file (object) to the server.
* Completely replaces file that exists at the specified URL with content in the entity body of `POST` HTTP request message.

	This method is often blocked on web servers.
	{:.warning}
	
### HTTP Response
This is the response that the server sends back to a client:

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 417
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=15
Date: Mon, 04 Oct 2021 11:40:11 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Thu, 03 Oct 2019 20:28:35 GMT
ETag: "1a1-594076e0ed808"
Accept-Ranges: bytes


<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>This is just a simple HTML page</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
<HR>
<H1>This is a Header</H1>
<H2>This is a Medium Header</H2>
Send me mail at <a href="mailto:support@yourcompany.com">
support@yourcompany.com</a>.
<P> This is a new paragraph!
<P> <B>This is a new paragraph!</B>
<BR> <B><I>This is a new sentence without a paragraph break, in bold
italics.</I></B>
<HR>
</BODY>
</HTML>
```

* The top line is the status line.
* Next are header lines.
* Then the data requested.
