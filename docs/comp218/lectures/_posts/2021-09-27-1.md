title: COMP218 - Module Overview & Automata Types
tags: COMP218 Lectures
---

The main points of study in this module are:

* Finite Automata:
	* Related to regex.
* Grammars:
	* Extracting the meaning from a program.
* Turing Machines:
	* The general model of computing.

## Some Kinds of Machines

| Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Finite Automata | Devices with a small amount of memory. Used to model very simple things. |
| Push-down Automata | Devices with infinite memory that can be accessed in a very limited way. Used to parse *grammars*. |
| Turing Machines | Devices with infinite memory. These are at lease as powerful as computers. |
| Resource-bounded Turing Machines | Infinite memory, but bounded by running time/memory. These are computers that run reasonably fast/efficiently. |
