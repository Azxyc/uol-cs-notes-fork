## Proving Non-Regularity
For all $n$ there exists $z$ longer than $n$, such that for all ways of writing $z=uvw$ where:

1. $\vert uv\vert\leq n$
1. $\vert v\vert\geq 1$
1. For all $i\geq0$, the string $uv^iw$ is **not** in $L$.

This is a Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé game between two players:

* Adam (for all)
* Eve (exists)

| Round | Adam | Eve |
| :-: | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Chooses $n$ | Chooses $z\in L(\vert z\vert >n)$
| 2 | Writes $z=uvw$ $(\vert uv\vert \leq n,\vert v\vert\geq1)$ | Chooses $i$ |

Eve wins if $uv^iw\notin L$ otherwise Adam wins.

Eve needs to give a **strategy** that, regardless of what Adam does, she always wins the game.

### Example
We will use our non-regular language as an example:

$$
L_0=\{0^n1^n\vert n\geq0\}
$$

| Round | Adam | Eve |
| :-: | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Chooses $n$ | Chooses $z=0^n1^n\in L_0$
| 2 | Writes $z=uvw$ as below: | Chooses $i=2$ |

Adam is able to choose this string in the language:

$$
\underbrace{00000000}_u\underbrace{00}_v\underbrace{001111111111}_w
$$

The $i=2$ constraint from eve produces this string which is not in the language, which means eve wins:

$$
\underbrace{00000000}_u\underbrace{00}_v\underbrace{00}_v\underbrace{001111111111}_w
$$

* $uv^2w=0^{n+k}1^n\notin L_0$
	* Where $k=\vert v\vert$.

Eve winning means that this is not a regular language.
