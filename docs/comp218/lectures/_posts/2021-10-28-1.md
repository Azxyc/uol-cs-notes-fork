## Precedence in Arithmetic Expressions
Consider we run the following in the python shell:

```python
>>> 2 + 3 * 5
17
```

This could be represented as the following trees:

```mermaid
graph
subgraph 25
25*[*] --- 25+[+] & 255[5]
25+ --- 252[2] & 253[3]
end
subgraph 17
17*[*] --- 17+[+] & 175[5]
17+ --- 172[2] & 173[3]
end
```

We know that the `17` tree has the correct **precedence**.

## Grammars
Consider that we have the following rules for a grammar:

```
EXPR -> EXPR + TERM
EXPR -> TERM
TERM -> TERM + TERM
TERM -> NUM
NUM -> 0-9
```

We can parse the same `2 + 3 * 5` as before like so:

```mermaid
graph
1[EXPR] --- 2[EXPR]
1 --- +
1 --- T1[TERM]
2 --- T2[TERM] --- N1[NUM] --- 22[2]
T1 --- T3[TERM] --- N2[NUM] --- 33[3]
T1 --- *
T1 --- N4[NUM] --- 5
```

By applying the rules we always get the correct precedence.

### Simplistic English Grammar
Consider that we can use the following rules in English:

```
SENTENCE -> NOUN-PHRASE VERB-PHRASE
NOUN-PHRASE -> A-NOUN
NOUN-PHRASE -> A-NOUN PREP-PHRASE
PREP-PHRASE -> PREP NOUN-PHRASE
```

With these rules we can make a sentence like the one below:

$$
\underbrace{\underbrace{\text{a girl }}_\text{A-NOUN}\underbrace{\underbrace{\text{with }}_\text{PREP}\underbrace{\text{a flower}}_\text{NOUN-PHRASE}}_\text{PREP-PHRASE}}_\text{SENTENCE}
$$

You can go further to define all parts of a language in order to make a grammar.
