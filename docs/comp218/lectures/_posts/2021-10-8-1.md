## Examples
For the alphabet:

$$\Sigma=\\{0,1\\}$$

* 0 followed by any nmber of 1s:

	$$
	01^* = 0(1^*) = \\{0, 01, 011, 0111, \ldots\\}
	$$
* 0 followed by  any number of 1s then 01:

	$$
	(01^*)(01) = \\{ 001, 0101,01101,011101,\ldots\\}
	$$

* Strings of length 1:
	
	$$0+1=\\{0,1\\}$$
	
* All strings in the alphabet:

	$$(0+1)^*=\\{\epsilon,0,1,00,01,10,11,\ldots\\}$$
* Any string that ends with 010:

	$$(0+1)^*010$$
* Any string that contains that pattern 01:

	$$(0+1)^*01(0+1)^*$$

## Complex Example
Consider the following regular expression:

$$((0+1)(0+1))^*+((0+1)(0+1)(0+1))^*$$

We can split it into the following fundamental parts:

* Strings of even length:

	$$((0+1)(0+1))^*$$
	
	This is as it is any number of strings of length 2.
	{:.info}
* Strings of length a multiple of 3:

	$$((0+1)(0+1)(0+1))^*$$
	
	This is because is is any number of string of length 3.
	{:.info}

The $+$ operator combines these two languages and as such the definition is:

> All strings whose length is **even or a multiple of 3**.
