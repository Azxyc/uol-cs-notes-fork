If a derivation is long enough, some variable must appear **twice on the same path** in a parse tree (pigeon hole principle):

* This means that any **sufficiently large** derivation will have a middle part that can be repeated indefinitely. 

## Pumping in General
Consider that you have a CFG that accepts the following string with a **production that repeats** at least once.:

$$
uvwxy
$$

We can make the production repeat more to create the following string:

$$
uv^2wx^2y
$$

Without repeating the production, the following is valid under the same language:

$$
uvy
$$

## Pumping Example
Consider the following language, you'd like to know whether it is a CFG:

$$
L=\{a^nb^nc^n:n\geq0\}
$$

If $L$ is a CFG then we should be able to split it into portions of $uv^nwx^ny$ and $uvy$. 

This is not possible with this language no matter how it is split.

## Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages
For every context-free language $L$:

There exists a numver $n$ such that for every string $z$ in $L$ longer than $n$, we can write $z=uvwxy$ where:

1. $\lvert vwx\rvert\leq n$
1. $\lvert vx\rvert\geq 1$
1. For every $i\geq0$, in the string $uv^iwx^iy$ is in the language $L$.

To prove that a language is not context-free we need to have one of two cases:

1. $v$ or $x$ contains two kinds of symbols:

	$$
	a\underbrace{aa\ldots aa}_vbbb\ldots \underbrace{bbcc}_xc\ldots cc
	$$
	
	Then $uv^2wx^2y$ is not in $L$ because the pattern is wrong.
	
1. $v$ or $x$ contains one kind of symbol:

	$$
	a\underbrace{aa\ldots }_vaabbb\ldots \underbrace{bb\ldots bb}_xc\ldots cc
	$$
	
	Then $uv^2wx^2y$ does not have the same number of $a$s $b$s and $c$s.
