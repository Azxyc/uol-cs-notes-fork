## Union
The union of two CFLs:

$$
L_1\cup L_2
$$

is context free.

In general, for two context free languages $L_1$ and $L_2$ with start variables $S_1$ and $S_2$ the grammar of the union can be represented as:

$$
S\rightarrow S_1\vert S_2
$$

Where all other productions are kept the same.

## Concatenation
The concatenation of two CFLs:

$$
L_1L_2
$$

is context free.

In general, for two context free languages $L_1$ and $L_2$ with start variables $S_1$ and $S_2$ the grammar of the concatenation can be represented as:

$$
S\rightarrow S_1S_2
$$

## Kleene Star
The star operation of a CFL:

$$
L^*
$$

is context free.

In general the star operation of a language can be represented as:

$$
S_1\text{ (new start variable)}\\
S_1\rightarrow SS_1\vert \epsilon
$$

## Intersection
The intersection of two CFLs:

$$
L_1\cap L_2
$$

is **not** necessarily context free.

## Complement
The complement of a CFL:

$$
\bar L
$$

is **not** necessarily context free.
