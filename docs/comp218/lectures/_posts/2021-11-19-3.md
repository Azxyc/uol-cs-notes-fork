## Intersection of Context-Free & Regular Languages
The intersection of a CFL and a regular language:

$$
L_1\cap L_2
$$

is context free.

### Combining the Languages
To combine the CFL $M_1$ (a PDA) and regular language $M_2$ (a DFA) we can use the following transformations:

* Transition 1
	
	```mermaid
	stateDiagram
	
	state M1 {
	direction lr
	q1 --> q2:a, b/c
	}
	state M2 {
	direction lr
	p1 --> p2:a
	}
	state M {
	direction lr
	q1,p1 --> q2,p2:a, b/c
	}
	M1 --> M
	M2 --> M
	```
* Transition 2
	
	```mermaid
	stateDiagram
	
	state M1 {
	direction lr
	q1 --> q2:epsilon, b/c
	}
	state M2 {
	direction lr
	p1
	}
	state M {
	direction lr
	q1,p1 --> q2,p1:epsilon, b/c
	}
	M1 --> M
	M2 --> M
	```
* Initial State

	```mermaid
	stateDiagram
	
	state M1 {
	direction lr
	[*] --> q0
	}
	state M2 {
	direction lr
	[*] --> p0
	}
	state M {
	direction lr
	[*] --> q0,p0
	}
	M1 --> M
	M2 --> M
	```
* Final States

	```mermaid
	stateDiagram
	
	state M1 {
	direction lr
	q1 --> [*]
	}
	state M2 {
	direction lr
	p1 --> [*]
	p2 --> [*]
	}
	state M {
	direction lr
	q1,p1 --> [*]
	q1,p2 --> [*]
	}
	M1 --> M
	M2 --> M
	```
	
### General Rules

* $M$ simulates in parallel $M_1$ and $M_2$.
* $M$ accepts string $w$ if and only if:
	* $M_1$ accepts string $w$ and,
	* $M_2$ accepts string $w$
	
	This is to say that $L(M)=L_1\cap L_2$.
	{:.info}
* As $M$ is a PDA then the final language ($L(M)=L_1\cap L_2$) is context-free.

## Applications of Regular Closure
You can use combinations of regular and context-free closures to prove that a language is context-free:

* If we can make a language as an intersection of context-free and regular languages, then we know that is it context-free.
	
	This allows you to prove that the language is context free without having to build a grammar.
