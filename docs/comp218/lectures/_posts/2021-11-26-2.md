Our formal model of a computer will use the following instruction set:

| Instruction | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `load x` | Put the value $x$ into $R_0$. |
| `load Rk` | Copy the value of $R_k$ into $R_0$. |
| `store Rk` | Copy the value of $R_0$ into $R_k$ |
| `read Rk` | Copy the value at memory location $R_k$ into $R_0$. |
| `write Rk` | Copy the value of $R_0$ into memory location $R_k$. |
| `add Rk` | Add $R_0$ and $R_k$, and put the result in $R_0$. |
| `jump n` | Set PC to $n$. |
| `jzero n` | Set PC to $n$, if $R_0$ is zero. |
| `jpos n` | Set the PC to $n$, if $R_0$ is positive. |

## Random Access Machines
Random access machines have the following memory components:

* $PC$ - Program Counter
* $R_x$ - Registers
* $M$ - Memory.

## Simulating a TM on a RAM

* Write the contents of the tape to $M$ where the language $\Gamma=\\{0,1,2,\ldots,k\\}$ with 0 being equal to a blank.
* Write the index of the head pointer to $R_0$

There is a full example of this in [the lecture](https://liverpool.instructure.com/courses/47455/modules/items/1252560).

## Simulating a RAM on a  2 Tape TM
The configuration of a RAM consists of:

* Program Counter
* Contents of Registers
* Indexes and contents of all non-empty memory cells.

Therefore for this RAM:

* PC - 14
* $R_0$ - 3
* $R_1$ - 17
* $R_2$ - 5
* $M$ - 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, ...

The configuration would be:

$$
(14, 3, 17, 5, (0, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2))
$$

The TM has a **simulation tape** and a **scratch tape**. The simulation tape stores the RAM configuration:

* The TM has a set of states corresponding to each program instruction of the RAM.
* The TM tape is updated according to RAM instructions.

There is a full example of simulating a RAM on a 2 tape Turing machine in [the lecture video](https://liverpool.instructure.com/courses/47455/modules/items/1252560)
