title: Running Time (P vs NP)

The **running time** of a TM $M$ is the function $t_M(n)$ where the function equals:

> The maximum number of steps that $M$ takes on any input of length $n$.

This is basically big O notation.

## Efficiency & the Church-Turing Thesis
Although different types of Turing machines are equally as powerful:

* They can't all compute the same problem in the same running time.

## Cobham-Edmonds Thesis

> A computational problem can be **feasibly solved** on a computational device only if they can be computed in **polynomial time**, i.e., in time $O(n^c)$ where $n$ is the size of the input and $c$ is some constant.

This can differ between machine architectures.

## P vs NP
* $P$ is the class of language that can be decided on a TM with **polynomial** running time in the input length.
* $NP$ is the class of language that can be decided on a **nondeterministic** TM with **polynomial** running time in the input length

It is an open question whether $P=NP$.
