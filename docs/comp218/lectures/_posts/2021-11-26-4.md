## Checking Decidability with a TM
To check whether a DFA is decidable, we can use a Turing machine.

For this we need to simulate the DFA $D$ with the input $w$ on the turing machine:

* If the simulation ends in an accepting state then the Turing machine accepts.
	* Otherwise reject.

To perform the simulation we complete the following:

1. Put markers on the start state of $D$ and the first symbol of $w$.
1. Until the marker for $w$ reaches the last symbol:
	* Update both markers.
1. If state marker is on accepting state, accept. 
	* Else reject.
	
We can also use our intuition to find decidability.

## Decidability

* Not all CFGs are decidable.
* Entscheidungs problem states that there is not algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable from the axioms using the rules of first-order logic.
