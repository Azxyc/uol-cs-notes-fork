As there could be more than one parse tree from a given input this can cause issues when trying to define the meaning of a string.

## Ambiguity
A CFG is **ambiguous** if some string has more than one parse tree.

Is $S\rightarrow SS\vert x$ ambiguous?

Yes as you could make the following parse trees for the same input:

```mermaid
graph 
subgraph B
1[S] --> 2[S] & 3[S]
2 --> 4[S] & 5[S]
4 --> 7[x]
5 --> 6[x]
3 --> 8[x]
end
subgraph A
21[S] --> 23[S] & 22[S]
23 --> 28[x]
22 --> 24[S] & 25[S]
24 --> 27[x]
25 --> 26[x]
end
```

## Disambiguation
Sometimes you can rewrite the grammar to remove ambiguity:

$$
S\rightarrow Sx\vert x
$$

This gives only the following parse tree for the previous input:

```mermaid
graph 
1[S] --> 2[S] & 3[x]
2 --> 4[S] & 5[x]
4 --> 6[x]
```

### Precedence
For situations, like mathematical operators, there should be a precedence that should be built into the parse tree.

In situations like this you can create a **new production** that **groups** the parse tree accordingly:

$$
\underbrace{\underbrace{2}_F*\underbrace{(\underbrace{1}_T+\underbrace{\underbrace{2}_F*\underbrace{2}_F)}_T}_F}_E
$$

Here the terms are split into factors $F$ and terms $T$.

This can be written as the following productions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E&\rightarrow T\vert E+T\\
T&\rightarrow F\vert T*F\\
F&\rightarrow(E)\vert1\vert2
\end{aligned}
$$

## Completeness
Disambiguation is **not always possible** because:

* There exists **inherently ambiguous** languages.
* There is **no general procedure** for disambiguation.

In programming languages, ambiguity comes from precedence rules, and we can deal with it like in the previous example.
