title: COMP218 - Regular Expressions & Translation of Regex to NFA
tags: COMP218 Tutorials
---

1. Give regular expressions for the following:
	1. The set of strings over alphabet $A=\{0,1\}$ that contains no two adjacent 1s:
	
		$$
		(1+\epsilon)(0^*01)^*0^*
		$$
	1. For the following state diagram:
	
		```mermaid
		stateDiagram-v2
		direction LR
		[*] --> 1
		1 --> 1:a,b
		1 --> 2:b
		2 --> 3:a,b
		3 --> 4:a,b
		3 --> [*]
		4 --> [*]
		```
		
		$$
		(a+b)^*b(a+b)(\epsilon +a+b)
		$$
1. Consider the following regular expressions which are given along with three words - for each word say whether it belongs to the language of the regular expression:
	1. $a^*b^*c^*d^*$
		* $abcd$ - Yes
		* $abbc$ - Yes
		* $aba$ - No
	1. $(ab)^*(abb)^*$
		* $ababab$ - Yes
		* $ababba$ - No
		* $ababbab$ - No
	
		For each pair of regular expressions below, say whether they represent the same
language. If they correspond to different languages, give an example of a word
that belongs to one language but not the other.
	
	1. $(a^*)\cup(b^*)$ and $\{a,b\}^*$ - No ($ab$)
	1. $\{a,ab,abc\}\{d,cd\}$ and $\{a,ab\}\{c,cd,d\}$ - No ($ac$)
	1. $(ab)^*\cup(aba)^*a$ and $a((ba)^*\cup(baa)^*)$ - No ($ab$)
