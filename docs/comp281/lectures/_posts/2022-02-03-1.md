## Hello, world!
A "Hello, world!" program would look something like so:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
	printf("Hello, World!\n");
	return 0;
}
```

You can then compile and run with the following commands:

```
$ gcc hello.c
$ ./a.out
Hello, world!
```

## Properties of C
### Advantages

* C is almost a portable assembly language. It is as **close to the machine** as possible while it is almost universally available for existing processor architectures.
* **Arbitrary memory address** access and **pointer arithmetic**.
* **Deterministic usage** of resources that fit for **resource-limited systems**.
* C has a **very small runtime**. The memory footprint for its code is smaller than for most other languages.
* Many implementations of new algorithms in books are **first** (or only) made available **in C** by their authors.
* C is an old and widespread language – it’s **easy to find** all kinds of **algorithms** written in C.

### Disadvantages

* No concept of **Object Oriented Programming** (OOP).
* No concept of **namespace**.
* No **constructor** or **destructor**.
* Difficult to debug.
* Compilers **cannot handle exceptions** (run-time errors).
* No strict data type checking:
	* An integer value can be passed for floating datatype.
