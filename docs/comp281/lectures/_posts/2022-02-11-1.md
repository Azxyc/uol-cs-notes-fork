## `while`
This checks the statement **before** running the statements:

```c
while (<expression>) {
	<statements>
}
```

Be aware of the limits of the data-types you are using if you are including counters in your while loops. `limits.h` has information regarding maximum values.

## `do` `while`
This checks the statement **after** running the statements:

```c
do {
	<statements>
} while (<expression>)
```

## `for`
The action is performed **after every** iteration:

```c
for (<initialisation>; <continuation>; <action>) {
	<statements>
}
```

You can **remove** values, such as pre-initialised variables, like so:

```c
int num = 10;
for (; num < 20;) {
	<statements>
	num++;
}
```

You can also create **multiple counters** like so:

```c
for (int i, int j; i < 10 || j < 20; i++, j++) {
	<statements>
}
```
 
## Other Flow Control Commands
### `continue`
The `continue` statement jumps to the next iteration of a loop when encountered.

### `break`
This statement "breaks" out of a loop. 

This is often used in `switch` `case` constructs.

### `goto`
This jumps directly to a label in the code:

```c
goto label;
label:
<statement>
```

This is rarely used as is makes the code hard to read.
