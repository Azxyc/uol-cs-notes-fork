## Arrays
An array consists of **contiguous memory** locations:

* The **highest** address corresponds to the **last** element.
* The **lowest** address corresponds to the **first** element. 

### Declaring Arrays
Arrays can be declared like so:

```c
float income[3];
```

This will create an array called `income` of type `float` that can hold three elements.

### Initialising Array
Arrays can be assigned in the following ways:

```c
income[0] = 198.76;
income[1]= 236.89;
income[2] = 218.54;
```

```c
float income[3] = {198.76, 236.89, 218.54};
```

This syntax is only available when declaring new arrays.
{:.warning}

Arrays can be partially initialised:

```c
float income[3] = {198.76, 236.89};
```

The rest of the values are zero.

```c
float income[];
```

The array contains garbage.

### Multi-dimensional Arrays
We can declare and assign multi-dimensional arrays like so:

```c
int arr[2][3]; /* not arr[2, 3] */
int i, j;
int sum = 0;
arr[0][0] = 12;
arr[0][1] = 23;
arr[0][2] = 34;
arr[1][0] = 45;
arr[1][1] = 56;
arr[1][2] = 67;
for ( i=0; i<2; i++ ) {
	for ( j=0; j<3; j++ ) {
		sum += arr[i][j];
	}
}
printf("sum = %d\n", sum);
```

This structure is laid out in memory with the all elements of arr[0] first, then arr[1] and so on.
{:.info}

When assigning implicitly, **all but the leftmost dimension** must be specified:

```c
int my_array[][3] = {{12, 23, 34}, {45, 56, 67}};
```

### Passing Arrays to Functions
As arrays are a **pointer to their first element** we can pass them to functions without passing a pointer:

```c
void foo(int arr[]) {
	arr[0] = 12;
}

int arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
foo(arr);
```

If we did this with a single value then the change wouldn't be reflected outside the scope of the function.

## Debugging
Both `lldb` and `gdb` are nice tools for debugging C but I will be using `gdb.

Before running code in a debugger it is nice to rememeber to include debugging symbols with -g:

```
gcc -Wall -g test.c -o test
```

Open the file with the debugger with:

```
gdb test
```

### Breakpoints
By setting a breakpoint we are able to step through the code:

```
b main
```

We can also use linenumbers for this.

### TUI Layouts
To see our code we can run:

```
layout src
```

If we have already set a layout before we can run `tui enable` to get to our last layout.
{:.info}

### Stepping Through Code
We can step through our code with the following commands:

| Command | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `n`, `next` | Steps to the next line. |
| `s`, `step` | Steps into the current line's function. |
| `c`, `continue` | Continue until the next breakpoint. |
| `finish` | Finishes execution of the current function and then pauses. |

### Variables
We can use the following commands to inspect variables:

| Command | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `p <var>`, `print <var>` | Prints the varaibles current value.
| `watch <var>` | Prints the variable whenever it changes. |
| `i lo`, `info locals` | Prints all arguments and local variables. |

We can also modify variables:

```
set var i = 2
```

### Frames
If you have several **nested functions** then you can use the following commands to navigate up and down the calling stack to view what is running at each level:

| Command | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `f`, `frame` | Shows the current line/frame you are in. |
| `up` | Moves up the calling stack one level. |
| `down` | Moves down the calling stack one level. |
| `ba`, `backtrace` | Shows the full calling stack. |
