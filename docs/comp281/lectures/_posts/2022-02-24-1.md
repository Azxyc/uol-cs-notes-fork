Pointers are a **variable** holding the **address** of another variable of the **same data type**.

You can use them to create:

* **Shared variables** between different functions without copying.
* **Linked data structures** such as linked lists.

## Addresses vs Pointers

* You can **get** the address of a variable using `&`.
* You can **store** that address in a pointer using `*`.

```c
int x = 9;
int *y = &x;
```

| Variable | Address | Value |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| `x` | 0xA0C1549 | 9 |
| `y` | 0xA0C1549 | 0xA0C1549 |

Pointers have their own addresses as they are a variable that holds an address.

## The `*` Operator
The star operator has several functions:

* Multiplication:
	
	```c
	a = b * c;
	```
* Declaring a pointer variable:

	```c
	int *a;
	```
* Dereferencing a pointer:

	```c
	printf("%d", *a);
	```

### Dereferencing
This operation **follows** the pointer's **reference** to get the value of its pointee.

```c
printf("%d", *a);
```

If we didn't dereference we will just get the value of the pointee's address.

If you are pointing to a pointer that points to the value (and so on), you need to dereference an appropriate amount of times to get the value you want:

```c
int x = 9;
int *y = &x;
int **z = &y;
printf("%d", **z);
```

## Initialisation
If you are not sure about which variable's address to assign to a pointer, use:

```c
int *ptr = NULL;
```

This ensures that the pointer is not pointing to some random place in memory.

## Call by Reference
To use a **reference** to a variable in a function, instead of **calling by value**, you can use the following:

```c
void incr(int *z) {
	(*z)++;
}

int main(void) {
	int x = 10;
	incr(&x);
	printf("&d", &x);
	return 0;
}
```

The brackets need to be used around z: `(*z)++` to avoid incrementing the pointer instead of the value.
