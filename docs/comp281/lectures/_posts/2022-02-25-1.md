## Arrays & Pointers
Arrays are a sugar for pointer arithmetic. We can emulate this behaviour like so:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()j {
	int i;
	int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
	int *p = arr;
	for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
		printf("%d\n", *p);
		p++;
	}
}
```

This prints out the first 4 elements of the array.

## Pointer Arithmetic
When adding or subtracting to a pointer like so:

```c
int *p = arr;
p++;
```

the value added is multiplied by the size of the type.

Hence 4 would be added to the pointer here to account for the size of `int`.

## Size of Pointer
A pointer to a type always has a size of **8 bytes** on a 64 bit machine:

```
sizeof(int) is 4
sizeof(char) is 1
sizeof(float) is 4
sizeof(double) is 8
==========
sizeof(int*) is 8
sizeof(char*) is 8
sizeof(float*) is 8
sizeof(double*) is 8
```

## Pointers with Functions
### Pointers as Function Arguments

* A pointer as a function parameter is used to hold the addresses of arguments passes during a function call (**call by reference**).
* When a function parameter is called by reference any change made to the reference variable will affect the original variable.

### Functions Returning Pointer Variables
A function can return a pointer to the calling function.

* **Local variables** of a function don't live outside of the function.

### Pointers to Functions
A pointer to a function can be used as an argument in another function.

To declare a pointer to a function:
	
```c
type (*pointer-name)(parameter);
```

We can use this like so:
	
```c
int (*s)(); // s is a pointer to a function with no parameters
	// it returns an int
```

We can then assign this to another function:

```c
s = sum; // assign s to sum function
```

#### Passing the Pointer to Another Function
We can then use this, to use a function in another function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int sum(int x, int y) {
	return x + y;
}
// This function takes a function that returns an int:
int sum6_9(int (*fp2)(int,int)){
	return (*fp2)(6, 9);
}
int main() {
	int (*fp)(int, int)
	fp = sum;
	printf("Sum is %d.\n", sum6_9(fp));
	return 0;
}
```

#### Using Function Pointers in Return Values
We can also have a function that houses many functions:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int sum(int x, int y) {
	return x + y;
}
int (*functionFactory(int z))(int, int) {
	printf("Got parameter %d.\n", z);
	int (*fp)(int,int) = sum;
	return fp;
}
int main() {
printf("Sum is %d.\n", functionFactory(3)(6,9));
return 0;
}
```
