## Hello, world!
C is also valid C++ code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
	printf("Hello World!\n");
}
```

but we can also use C++ features:

```c++
#include <iostream>
int main() {
	std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
}
```

## Header Files
We can use C header files in C++ but there are often C++ versions of the same. For example, we can find the length of a string like so:

```c++
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
	std::string hello = "hello";
	int x = hello.size();
	std::cout << hello << " is of length " << x;
}
```

In C you would use `strlen()`.

## Namespaces
Namespaces are like packages, for example:

```c++
std::cout
```

means that `cout` is defined inn the `std` namespace.

We can set a **default** namespace like so:

```c++
#include <string.h>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	string hello = "hello";
	int x = hello.length();
	cout << hello << " is of length " << x;
}
```

This saves us writing `std::` all the time.

## Input Syntax
We can use something like the following to read input:

```c++
#include <iostream>
int main() {
	std::string bla;
	int num;
	std::cin >> num >> bla;
	std::cout << bla << " " << num;
}
```

This can work with integers and strings, and reads up to the first space for each variable.
