## Overloading
### Types of Operators
There are three types of operator in C++:

* Prefix Unary - `--counter`
* Postfix Unary - `counter++`
* Binary - `num1 - num2`

### Unary Operators
To overload **prefix** unary operators we write:

```c++
returntype operator-();
```

This will override `-`.

To overload **postfix** unary operators we write:

```c++
returntype operator++(int);
```

The `int` type only means that we are defining the postfix version instead of the prefix one.

### Binary Operators
To overload a binary operator we can do the following:

```c++
returntype operator+(righthandtype& r);
```

### Friends
A friends declaration appears in a class body and **grants a functio**n, or another class, **access to private and protected members** of the class where the friend declaration appears.

Friendship is only one-way and is not inherited.

#### Redefining `<<` for `cout`
To print our ruler objects we need to override `<<` from `ostream` so that it knows how to output the type.

To start define the function in the class:

```c++
friend std::ostream& operator<<(std:ostream& output, const Ruler& ru);
```

We can then define that function elsewhere:

```c++
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& output, const Ruler& ru) {
	output << ru.feet << "'" << ru.inches << '"';
	return output;
}
```

We can do a similar thing for overriding `>>`.

There will be additional examples of this in the labs.

## Templates
Consider that we want to write a function to compare many different types of classes. Instead of writing many functions to do this, we can write one function **to rule them all**:

```c++
template <class T>
bool compare(T& t1, T& t2) {
	return t1 < t2;
}
```

We can then use this template like so:

```c++
compare<Ruler>(r1, r2);
compare<string>(s1, s2);
```

You can also make templates that take multiple classes:

```c++
template <class T, class U>
bool compare(T& t1, U& u2) {
	return t1 < u2;
}
```

### Class Templates
To return two different objects from a single function we can use a class template:

```c++
template <class T, class U>
class TwoObjects {
	public
	T first;
	U second;
	TwoObjects(T f, U s) : first(f), second(s) {}
}
```

```c++
TwoObjects<Animal, int> method();
```

This is implemented by `Pair` in the **standard template library**.
