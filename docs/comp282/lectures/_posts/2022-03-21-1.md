## Standard Template Library
Each template consists of three main parts:

* Containers - Standard data structures.
* Iterators - Standard ways to move through the standard data structures.
* Algorithms - Use iterators to complete a task with data.

### Containers
An example of a container is a `vector` this is how you would initialise a `vector`:

```c++
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	vector<int> store;
}
```

A vector is an automatically sizing array.

You can use the algorithms of a container using dot noation: `store.back()`.

### Iterators
Iterators point to an object in an array, or container. They can iterate through the objects in a logical way, by using overloaded operators such as `++`.

See [https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/) for the properties of each iterator category. We can use the functions at the bottom of the page to control the iterator.

If a type is well-defined then we can replace the standard iterator declaration:

```c++
multiset<int>::iterator it = store.begin();
```

with **either** of the following:

```c++
auto it = store.begin();
for (int x : store) { 
	cout << x;
}
```

```c++
for (auto x : store) {
	cout << x;
}
```

#### STL Arrays
There is also an `array` container, in C++, that enable the use of iterators and algorithms:

```c++
#include <array>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	array<long, 5> arr;
	arr.fill(1); // all elements are 1
	for (auto x : arr) {
		cout << x;
	}
}
```
