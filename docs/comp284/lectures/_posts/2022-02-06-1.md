## Web-Based Application Interfaces
Web-based applications are **client-server** applications where:

1. The **client software**, consisting of a user interface and client-side logic of the application, run in a web browser.
1. Static aspects of a user interface are realised using **HTML**.
1. The client software incorporates **user inputs** into a HTTP request that it **sends to a web server** to retrieve information or to update parts of itself. 
1. The web server uses a program, the **server software**, to compute an HTTP response that it sends back the web browser.

## HTML
### Elements

* A **HTML element** is an individual component of a HTML document. 
* Most element consist of a **start tag** and a matching **end tag** with some content in-between.

The general form of a start tag is like so:

```html
<tagName attrib1="value" attribN="valueN">
```

and an end tag looks like the following:

```html
</tagName>
```

#### Void Elements
These are HTML elements that only have a starting  tag such as:

* `area`
* `base`
* `br`

Since they have no content, they **cannot** be nested.
{:.info}

The start tag of **void elements** can be made **self-closing** by ending the tag with `/>` instead of `>` like so:

```html
<br/>
```

### Documents
An HTML5 document begins with a `DOCTYPE` declaration and an `html` element like so:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
</html>
```

It is recommended that the start tag **specifies the language** used in the document:

```html
<html lang="en-GB">
```

### Forms
Forms allow users to enter data which can be sent to a web server. It has several optional attributes, including:

| Attribute | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `action` | URL to use for form submission. |
| `method` | HTTP method to use for form submission (`get` or `post`). |
| `enctype` | The encoding type to use for form submission. |
| `novalidate` | Form is not validated during submission. |

You would use these attributes like so:

```html
<form action="https://sam.csc.liv.ac.uk/COMP/Calendar.pl" method="post" enctype="text/plain">
</form>
```

#### Input
The input element represents a field that allows the user to **enter data** of a certain type. 

The input element is a **void element**.
{:.info}

The `type` attribute of an input element determines what type of data can be entered and in what form. 

| Value of Type | Data Type | Form Control |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `text` | Text with no line breaks | Text field. |
| `number` | Floating-point number. | Text field or spinner. |
| `password` | Password | Text field with obscured input. |
| `button` | | Button |
| `submit` | Initiates form submission. | Button |
| `reset` | Resets the form. | Button |

You can use them like so:

```html 
<input type="text">
<input type="reset">
```

Common attributes of input elements include the following:

| Attribute | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `id` | A unique id used to identify the element within the document. |
| `name` | A unique name used by the form processor to access input. |
| `autofocus` | Automatically focus on this form control when the page is loaded. |
| `disabled` | Whether the form control is disabled. |
| `required` | Whether the form control is required to have a non-empty value for form submission. |

#### Labels
In order for a form to be readable, each form control should be accompanied by an indication of what it is. A **label element is a caption** the can be associated with a specific form control. 

It can be used in the following ways:

```html
<label for="s1">Surname:</label>
<input type="text" name="surname" id="s1">
```

```html
<label>
	First names(s):
	<input type="text" name="first" id="f1">
</label>
```

#### Form Example
You can put this all together using the following HTML which would render like so:

```html
<form action="process.py">
	<label for="s1">Surname:</label>
	<input type="text" name="surname" id="s1">
	<label>
		First Name:
		<input type="text" name="first" id="f1">
	</label>
	<label>
		Student ID:
		<input type="number name="studentid" id="sid" min="190000000" max="999999999">
	</label>
	<input type="submit">
</form> 
```

---

<form action="">
	<label for="s1">Surname:</label>
	<input type="text" name="surname" id="s1">
	<label>
		First Name:
		<input type="text" name="first" id="f1">
	</label>
	<label>
		Student ID:
		<input type="number" name="studentid" id="sid" min="190000000" max="999999999">
	</label>
	<input type="submit">
</form>

---

A string composed of `name=value` pairs will be sent to the `action` program.
{:.info}

**HTML encoding** is used on strings.
{:.warning}

#### Select
A select element represents a drop-down menu with pre-defined options. They can be made with the following HTML and render like so:

```html
<label for="m1">Select a module:</label>
<select name="module" id="m1">
	<option value="COMP201">COMP201: Software Engineering I</option>
	<option value="COMP207">COMP207: Database Development</option>
	<option value="COMP211">COMP211: Computer Networks</option>
</select>
```

---

<label for="m1">Select a module:</label>
<select name="module" id="m1">
	<option value="COMP201">COMP201: Software Engineering I</option>
	<option value="COMP207">COMP207: Database Development</option>
	<option value="COMP211">COMP211: Computer Networks</option>
</select>

---

* By default, the **first option** is selected.
* If the selection is not changed and the user activates the submit button then `module=COMP201` is sent to the server.
* If the default element has an **empty value** then the user is forced to make a choice.

## Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
This is a standard method for web server to use an external application, a CGI program, to **dynamically generate web pages**.

1. A web client generates an HTTP request and sends it to a web server.
1. The web server selects a CGI program to handle the request, converts the HTTP request to a CGI request and executes the program.
* The CGI program then processes the CGI request and the server passes the program's response back to the client.

### GET vs POST
There are two main request methods used by HTML forms:

* `GET`:
	* The browser appends the form data to the URI in the request:
	
	```
	<scheme> "://" <server-name> ":" <server-port> <script-path> <extra-path> "?" <query-string>
	```
	* They are limited to between 1KB and 8KB depending on the browser and server.
	* Requests **remain in the browser history** and can be bookmarked.
	* They should **not** be used for sensitive data such as passwords.
* `POST`:
	* The browser appeds the form datat to the body of the request.
	* No limit on the length of the request.
	* They **don't** remain in the browser history.
	* They **are suitable** for transfer of sensitive information.
	
#### Sever Interaction
The server can access this information in the following ways:

* `GET`:
	* Form data is provided tot he CGI program via the `QUERY_STRING` environment variable.
* `POST`:
	* Form data is provided to CGI programs via the **standard input**.
	
The following environment variables are also available to the CGI:

| Variable | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| REQUEST_METHOD | The request method that was used. |
| HTTP_USER_AGENT | The browser issuing the request. |
| HTTP_REFERER | The URL of the document that the browser points to before accessing the CGI program. |
| HTTP_ACCEPT | A list of the MIME types that the browser can accept. |
| REMOTE_ADDR | The remote IP address of the device from which the request came. |

### CGI Program in Python
We can use python to make a CGI program by using the following features:

* `environ` dictionary of the `os` module to access the environment variables.
* `cgi` module to process and decode form data.
* `print` statements to produce HTML markup.

#### Accessing Environment Variables
We can access environment variables like so:

```python
os.environ['REQUEST_METHOD']
```

This might return the string such as `GET`.

#### Accessing Form Data
To access form data we can use the `cgi` module like so:

1. Create an instance of the `FieldStorage` class and assign it to a variable:

	```python
	variable = cgi.FieldStorage()
	```
	
	This reads the form data from the standard input, or the environment variable `QUERY_STRING`.
1. We can then use the following functions to get the data:

	```python
	variable['name'].value
	varaible.getvalue('name')
	variable.getfirst('name', default=None)
	variable.getlist('name')
	```
	
### CGI Wrapper Example
Consider that we want to develop a CGI program for a username generator with the following functionality:

* Access is restricted to IP addresses starting with `128.253` (for the University of Liverpool).
* The program point out a HTML document with an HTML form that allows a user to enter the data required fro our program.
	* The drop-down menu should cover the previous nine years plus the current year.
* On submission of the completed form, the program:
	* Generates a user name based on the data that was entered into the form.
	* Prints out an HTML document with that username.
	
#### HTML Wrapper
This code define functions that can print outh the initial and final part for some HTML markup:

```python
# htmlUH.py

def startHTML(title):
	print('''\
Content-type: text/html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en-GB'>
	<head>
		<meta charset='utf-8'>
		<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='form.css'>
		<title>''' + title + '''</title>
	</head>
	<body>''')
	
def endHTML():
	print('''
	</body>
</html>''')
```

#### HTML Form
We can then use the following python to make the form:

```python
def printForm():
	print('''\
<form action='generate.py' method='post'>
	<label>
		Enter your full name:
		<input type='text' name='fullname'>
	</label>
	<label>
		Select your year of registration:
		<select name='year' required>
			<option value=''>
				----
			</option>''')
	now = datetime.datetime.now()
	for year in range(now.year - 9, now.year + 1):
		print('<option>',year, '</option>')
	print('''\
		</select>
	</label>
	<input type='submit' name='submit' value='Generate'>
</form>''')
```

#### Generating Username
We can use the following function to generate a username:

```python
def genUsername(name, year):
	# first letter of given name/names
	return ("sg" + name.split()[0][0].lower()
	# first three letter of surname
	+ name.split()[-1][:3].lower()
	# last two digits of year
	+ str(year)[2:4])
```

#### Wrapper Script

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
# generate.py

import os, sys, codecs, datetime, locale
from htmlUH import start_html, end_html

start_html("Generate Username")
if (os.environ["REMOTE_ADDR"][0:7] != "138.253"):
	print('<div><b>Sorry, please come back when you are on a uni computer</b></div>')
else:
	inputs = cgi.FeildStorage()
	if inputs.getvalue('submit'j):
		# form has been completed and submitted
		name = inputs['fullname'].value
		year = inputs['year'].value
		username = genUsername(name, year)
		print('<div>The username for ' + name + ' registerd in ' + year + ' is ' + username + '</div>')
	else:
		# show user the form
		printForm()
end_html()
```
