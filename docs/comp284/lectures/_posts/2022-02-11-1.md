## Comparison Operators
**Type juggling** affects the way that comparisons work in PHP, consequently there are some additional competitors:

| Expression | Name | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `expr1 == expr2` | Equal | TRUE if `expr1` is equal to `expr2` after type juggling. |
| `expr1 != expr2` | Not Equal | TRUE if `expr1` is not equal to `expr2` after type juggling. |
| `expr1 <> expr2` | Not Equal | TRUE if `expr1` is not equal to `expr2` after type juggling. |
| `expr1 === expr2` | Identical | TRUE if `expr1` is equal to `expr2` and they are the same type. |
| `expr1 !== expr2` | Identical | TRUE if `expr1` is not equal to `expr2` or they are not the same type. |

Comparing `NAN` and `INF` are also possible but may not behave as expected in PHP versions earlier than 5.3.

You can compare strings **as strings** using the following function:

| Expression | Name | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `strcmp(expr1, expr2)` | String Comparison | Returns < 0 if expr1 is **less than** expr2,<br>> 0 if expr1 is **greater than** expr2,<br>0 of expr1 is **equal to** expr2. |

You can convert strings to numbers and compare using the **spaceship operator**:

| Expression | Name | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `expr1 <=> expr2` | Three-way Comparison | Returns -1 if expr1 is **less than** expr2,<br> +1 if expr1 is **greater than** expr2,<br>0 of expr1 is **equal to** expr2.

### `NAN` & `INF` Comparisons
PHP provides three functions to test whether a value is one of these values:

| Expression | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| *bool* `is_nan(<value>)` | Returns TRUE if the value is `NAN`. |
| *bool* `is_infinite(<value>)` | Returns TRUE if the value is `INF` **or** `-INF`. |
| *bool* `is_finite(<value>)` | Returns TRUE if the value is **neither** `NAN` **nor** `INF` **or** `-INF`.

## Arrays
### Creating Arrays
PHP **only** supports **hash tables**, hence they are just referred to as arrays. They are created like so:

```php
array(key1 => value1, key2 => value2)
[key1 => value1, key2 => value2]
```

* `key` - Is an **integer** or **string**.
* `value` - Can be of any type, including arrays:
	
	```php
	$arr2 = array (200846369 = > array (
		"name" = > "Jan Olsen",
		"COMP201" = > 69,
		"COMP207" = > 52
		)
	);
	```
	
The **size** of an array can be determined using the `count` function:

```
count(array[, mode])
```

using them on the **above array** would yield the following results:

```php
print count($arr2);	// prints 1
print count($arr2, 1)	// prints 4
```

You can **omit the keys** when creating an array:

```php
$arr3 = array("Peter", "Paul", "Mary");
```

This will automatically generate the keys as **natural numbers** (0, 1, ...).
{:.info}

You can add a value to the **end of an array** using the following assingment:

```php
$arr4[] = 51;	// 0 => 51
$arr4[] = 42;	// 1=> 42
```

### Reading Arrays
All of the **keys of an array** can be fetched with the following function:

```php
array_keys($array1)
```

this will return a natural number indexed array containing the keys of `array1`.

All of the **values of an array** can be fetched with the following function:

```php
array_values($array1)
```

this will return a natural number indexed array containing the values stored in `array1`.

You can access an element of an array via its **key**:

```php
$arr1 = array (1 => "Peter", 3 = > 2009, "a" => 101);
print "'a' = > " . $arr1 ["a"] . "\ n" ;
```

```
'a' => 101
```

Accessing an **undefined key** returns `NULL`.
{:.info}

You can use the following function to check if a **key** exists in an array:

```php
array_key_exists("a", $arr1) // returns TRUE
```

### `foreach-loop`
You can loop through **all the mappings of an array** using the following structure:

```php
foreach (<array> as $value) {
	<statement>;
}

foreach (<array> as $key => $value) {
	<statement>;
}
```

Arrays are **not sorted** so the values are returned in **insertion order**.
{:.warning}

In order to **change the values** of an array using a for each loop you need to use a **reference** (`&`):

```php
foreach ($arr6 as $key => &$value) { // note the &
	$value .= " - modified";
}
```

* This is required, otherwise a copy will be modified.
* Unsetting the pointier is required to remove the structure from memory.
* You can't change the **key**, only the **value**.

### Array Assignments
PHP uses **copy-on-write** for array assignments. This means that if you create a copy of an array:

```php
$arr2 = $arr1;
```

they are treated as a reference to eachother (this saves the memory of writing it twice).

When one is changed:

```php
$arr2[1] += 1000;
```

then the other copy is written to memory. 

This means that `$arr2` is no longer a pointer to `$arr1` and is now its own array.
{:.info}

If you explicitly want a **reference** then you can do the following:

```php
$arr2 = &$arr1;
```

This will create an **alias** for the same array.
