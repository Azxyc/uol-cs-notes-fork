## Comparison Operators
**Type juggling** affects the way that comparisons work in PHP, consequently there are some additional competitors:

| Expression | Name | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `expr1 == expr2` | Equal | TRUE if `expr1` is equal to `expr2` after type juggling. |
| `expr1 != expr2` | Not Equal | TRUE if `expr1` is not equal to `expr2` after type juggling. |
| `expr1 <> expr2` | Not Equal | TRUE if `expr1` is not equal to `expr2` after type juggling. |
| `expr1 === expr2` | Identical | TRUE if `expr1` is equal to `expr2` and they are the same type. |
| `expr1 !== expr2` | Identical | TRUE if `expr1` is not equal to `expr2` or they are not the same type. |

Comparing `NAN` and `INF` are also possible but may not behave as expected in PHP versions earlier than 5.3.
{:.info}

You can compare strings **as strings** using the following function:

| Expression | Name | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `strcmp(expr1, expr2)` | String Comparison | Returns < 0 if expr1 is **less than** expr2,<br>> 0 if expr1 is **greater than** expr2,<br>0 of expr1 is **equal to** expr2. |

You can convert strings to numbers and compare using the **spaceship operator**:

| Expression | Name | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `expr1 <=> expr2` | Three-way Comparison | Returns -1 if expr1 is **less than** expr2,<br> +1 if expr1 is **greater than** expr2,<br>0 of expr1 is **equal to** expr2.

### `NAN` & `INF` Comparisons
PHP provides three functions to test whether a value is one of these values:

| Expression | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| *bool* `is_nan(<value>)` | Returns TRUE if the value is `NAN`. |
| *bool* `is_infinite(<value>)` | Returns TRUE if the value is `INF` **or** `-INF`. |
| *bool* `is_finite(<value>)` | Returns TRUE if the value is **neither** `NAN` **nor** `INF` **or** `-INF`.

## Arrays
### Creating Arrays
PHP **only** supports **hash tables**, hence they are just referred to as arrays. They are created like so:

```php
array(key1 => value1, key2 => value2)
[key1 => value1, key2 => value2]
```

* `key` - Is an **integer** or **string**.
* `value` - Can be of any type, including arrays:
	
	```php
	$arr2 = array (200846369 = > array (
		"name" = > "Jan Olsen",
		"COMP201" = > 69,
		"COMP207" = > 52
		)
	);
	```
	
The **size** of an array can be determined using the `count` function:

```
count(array[, mode])
```

using them on the **above array** would yield the following results:

```php
print count($arr2);	// prints 1
print count($arr2, 1)	// prints 4
```

You can **omit the keys** when creating an array:

```php
$arr3 = array("Peter", "Paul", "Mary");
```

This will automatically generate the keys as **natural numbers** (0, 1, ...).
{:.info}

You can add a value to the **end of an array** using the following assingment:

```php
$arr4[] = 51;	// 0 => 51
$arr4[] = 42;	// 1=> 42
```

### Reading Arrays
All of the **keys of an array** can be fetched with the following function:

```php
array_keys($array1)
```

this will return a natural number indexed array containing the keys of `array1`.

All of the **values of an array** can be fetched with the following function:

```php
array_values($array1)
```

this will return a natural number indexed array containing the values stored in `array1`.

You can access an element of an array via its **key**:

```php
$arr1 = array (1 => "Peter", 3 = > 2009, "a" => 101);
print "'a' = > " . $arr1 ["a"] . "\ n" ;
```

```
'a' => 101
```

Accessing an **undefined key** returns `NULL`.
{:.info}

You can use the following function to check if a **key** exists in an array:

```php
array_key_exists("a", $arr1) // returns TRUE
```

### `foreach-loop`
You can loop through **all the mappings of an array** using the following structure:

```php
foreach (<array> as $value) {
	<statement>;
}

foreach (<array> as $key => $value) {
	<statement>;
}
```

Arrays are **not sorted** so the values are returned in **insertion order**.
{:.warning}

In order to **change the values** of an array using a for each loop you need to use a **reference** (`&`):

```php
foreach ($arr6 as $key => &$value) { // note the &
	$value .= " - modified";
}
```

* This is required, otherwise a copy will be modified.
* Unsetting the pointier is required to remove the structure from memory.
* You can't change the **key**, only the **value**.

### Array Assignments
PHP uses **copy-on-write** for array assignments. This means that if you create a copy of an array:

```php
$arr2 = $arr1;
```

they are treated as a reference to eachother (this saves the memory of writing it twice).

When one is changed:

```php
$arr2[1] += 1000;
```

then the other copy is written to memory. 

This means that `$arr2` is no longer a pointer to `$arr1` and is now its own array.
{:.info}

If you explicitly want a **reference** then you can do the following:

```php
$arr2 = &$arr1;
```

This will create an **alias** for the same array.
{:.info}

### Array Operators
PHP has no **stack** or **queue** datastructures. We can use the following functions with arrays to emulate these features:

| Function | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `array_push(&$array, value1, value2, ...)` | Appends one, or more, elements at the end of an array. Returns the number of elements in the resulting array. |
| `array_pop(&$array)` | Extracts the last element from an array and returns it. |
| `array_shift(&$array)` | Extract the first element of an array and returns it. |
| `array_unshift(&$array, value1, value2, ...)` | Inserts one or more elements at the start of an array variable. Returns the number of elements in the resulting array. |

## Printing
In PHP the **default** command for generating output is `echo`:

```php
echo(arg1);
echo arg1, arg2, ...
```

No brackets are allowed if there is more than one argument.
{:.warning}

This method is more efficient that `printf` so should be used when possible.
{:.success}

Additionally there are also the functions `print` and `printf`:

| Function | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `print(arg)` | Takes **one** argument only and returns value 1. Brackets can be omitted. |
| `printf(format, arg1, arg2, ...)` | Produces output according to `format`. Returns the length of the output string. |
| `sprintf(format, arg1, arg2, ...)` | Returns a string produced according to the `format`. |
| `vprintf(format array)` | Same as `printf` by accepts an array instead of comma separated values. |
| `vsprintf(format, array)` | Same as `sprintf` and `vprintf`. |

## `NULL`
A **variable** can have the value and type of `NULL` in the following situations:

* The variable has not yet been assigned a value.
* The variable has been assigned the value `NULL`.
* The variable has been `unset`.

You can use the following function to sets whether a variable is `NULL`:

| Function | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `isset($variable)` | True if `$variable` exists and does not have value `NULL`. |
| `is_null(expr)` | True if `expr` is identical to `NULL`. |

Empty arrays are only loosely (`==`) equal to `NULL` but not identical (`===`).
{:.warning}

## Resources
A resource is a reference to an external file. We can use the following functions:

| Function | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `fopen(filename, mode)` | Returns a file pointer for `filename` on success, false on error. |
| `fclose(resource)` | Closes the resource. Returns true on success. |
| `fgets(resource [, length])` | Returns a line read from `resource` and returns false if there is no more data to read. `length` can be used to read the first $n$ characters, or until the end of the line. |
| `fread(resource, length)` | Returns length charactesr read from `resource`. |
| `fwrite(resource, string [, length])` | Writes a string to a resource. If `length` is given, writing stops after `length` bytes, or the end of the string. |
| `fprintf(resource, format, arg1, arg2, ...)` | Same as `printf` with output to `resource`. |
| `vfprintf(resource, format, array)` | Same as `vprintf` with output to `resource`. |

We can use the following **modes**:

| Mode | Operation | Create | Truncate |
| :-- | :-- | :-: | :-: |
| `r` | Read File | | |
| `r+` | Read/Write File | | |
| `w` | Write File | Y | Y |
| `w+` | Read/Write File | Y | Y |
| `a` | Append File | Y | |
| `a+` | Read/Append File | Y | |
| `x` | Write File | Y | |
| `x+` | Read/Write File | Y | |

Here are some common file operations:

```php
$handle = fopen('somefile.txt', 'r');
while ($line = fgets($handle)) {
	// processing each line
}
fclose($handle);
```

```php
$handle = fopen('somefile.txt', 'w');
fwrite($handle, "Hello, World!".PHP_EOL);	// platform dependant newline
fclose($handle);
```
