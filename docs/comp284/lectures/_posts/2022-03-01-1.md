## Defining Classes
Classes are defined like so:

```php
class identifier {
	property_definitions
	function_definitions
}
```

Function definition may include the definition of a constructor.
{:.info}

An object of a class is created using:

```php
new identifier(arg1, arg2, ...)
```

The definition of a class typically looks like so:

```php
class identifier {
	# Properties
	vis $attrib1
	...
	vis $attribN = value
	
	# Constructor
	function __construct(p1, ...) i{
		statements
	}
	# Methods
	vis function method1(p1, ...) {
		statements
	}
	vis function methodN(p1, ...) {
		statements
	}
}
```

`vis` is a declaration of visbility.
{:.info}

We can access the **methods** and **objects** of a class like so:

```php
obj->attrib1 ...
obj->method1(a1) ...
```

## `$this`
We can use the **pseudo-variable** `$this` as a reference to the **current object** like so:

```php
class Rectangle {
	protected $height;
	protected $width;
	
	function __construct($height, $width) {
		$this->width = $width;
		$this->height = $height;
	}
}
```

## Visibility
Properties and methods can have the following visibilities:

* `public` - Accessible everywhere.
* `private` - Accessible only within the same class. 
* `protected` - Accessible only within the class itself, by inheriting and parent classes.

Properties **require** a visibility declaration whereas, by default, methods are `public`.
{:.info}

## Constants
Classes can have their own constants. By default they are declared `public`:

* Class constants are allocated once per class and not for each class instance.
* Class constants are accessed using the **scope resolution operator** `::`:

```php
class MyClass {
	const SIZE = 10;
}
echo MyClass::SIZE;	# prints 10
$o = new MyClass();
echo $o::SIZE;	# prints 10
```

## Destructors
A class can have a destructor method that is called as soon as there are no references to a particular object:

```php
class Employee {
	static $totalNumber = 0;
	public $name;
	
	function __construct($name) {
		$this->name = $name;
		Employee::$totalNumber++
	}
	function __destruct() {
		Employee::$totalNumber--;
	}
}

$e1 = new Employee("Ada");
$e2 = new Employee("Ben");
echo Employee:$totalNumber	# prints 2
$e1 = null;
echo Employee::$totalNumber	# prints 1
```

## Inheritance
Inheritance can be implemented like so:

```php
class Rectangle {
	protected $height;
	protected $width;
	
	function __construct($height, $width) {
		$this->height = $height;
		$this->width = $width;
	}
	function area() {
		return $this->width * $this->height;
	}
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
	function __construct($size) {
		parent::__construct($size, $size);
	}
}

$rt = new Rectangle(3, 4);
echo "\$rt1 area = ", $rt1->area(), "\n";
$sq1 = new Square(5);
echo "\$sq1 area = ", $sq1->area(), "\n";
```

```
$rt1 area = 12
$sq1 area = 25
```

* The constructor of the parent class is **not automatically called**. It must be called **explicitly** from the child class.
* Inherited constants, properties and methods can be overridden by **re-declaring** them with the same name defined in the parent class.
* The declaration `final` can be used to prevent a method from being overridden.
* Using `parent::` it is possible to access overridden methods or static properties of the parent class.
* Using `self::` it is possible to access static properties and methods of the current class. 

## Interfaces
Interfaces specify which methods a class must implement, without providing an implementation:

```php
interface Shape {
	public function area();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
	...
}
```

* All methods in an interface **must** be declared public.

## Introspection Functions

| Function | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `class_exists(class)` | Returns `TRUE` if a class `class` exists. |
| `get_class(obj)` | Returns the name of the class to which an object belongs. |
| `is_a(obj, class)` | Returns `TRUE` if `obj` is an instance of the class named `class`. |
| `method_exists(obj, method)` | Returns `TRUE` if `obj` has a method named `method`. |
| `property_exists(obj, property)` | Returns `TRUE` if `obj` has an property named `property`. |
| `get_object_vars(object)` | Returns an array with the accessible non-static properties of `object` mapped to their values. |
| `get_class_methods(class)` | Returns an array of method names for `class`. |

`property` and `class` are read in as strings.
