title: The PDO Class (Databases in PHP)

The PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension defines an interface for accessing databases in PHP.

## Connections
We create a connection to the database server by creating an instance of the PDO class. We can use the following constructor to this:

```php
$pdo = new PDO(dsn, username, password, options);
```

The connection remains open for the lifetime of the object. Therefore, we can close the connection by running the following:

```php
$pdo = NULL
```

A full example would look like so:

```php
# Connection information for the Departmental MySQL Server
$host
= " studdb . csc . liv . ac . uk " ;
$user
= " sgfsurn " ; # your University username
$passwd = " ------- " ; # your MySQL server account password
$db
= " sgfsurn " ; # your University username
$charset = " utf8mb4 " ;
$dsn
= " mysql : host = $host ; dbname = $db ; charset = $charset " ;
# Useful options
$opt = array (
PDO :: ATTR_ERRMODE
= > PDO :: ERRMODE_EXCEPTION ,
PDO :: AT T R _ D E F A U L T _ F ET CH _ MO DE = > PDO :: FETCH_ASSOC ,
PDO :: A T T R _ E M U L A T E _ P REPAR ES
= > false
);
try {
$pdo = new PDO ( $dsn , $user , $passwd , $opt );
} catch ( PDOException $e ) {
echo ' Connection failed : ' ,$e - > getMessage ();
}
```

## Queries
The `query()` method of PDO object can be used to execute an SQL query:

```php
$result = $pdo->query("SELECT * FROM meetings");
```

The `exec()` method of PDO objects executes an SQL statement, returning the number of roes affected by the statement:

```php
$rowNum = $pdo->exec("DELETE * FROM meetings");
```

## Processing Result Sets
To get a single row as an array from a result set stored in a `PDOStatement` object, we can use the `fetch()` method.

By default, PDO returns each row as an array indexed by the **column name** and a 0-indexed **column position** in the row:

```php
$row = $result - > fetch ()
```

```php
array ( ' slot ' = > 1 ,
' name ' = > ' Michael North ' ,
' email ' = > 'M . North@student . liverpool . ac . uk ' ,
0 => 1,
1 = > ' Michael North ' ,
2 = > 'M . North@student . liverpool . ac . uk ')
```
