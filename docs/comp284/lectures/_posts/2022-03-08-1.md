JavaScript is a language for **client-side** programming.

## Hello, world!

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-GB">
<head>
	<title>Hello, world!</title>
</head>
<body>
	<script>
		document.writeln("<p><b>Hello, world!</b></p>");
	</script>
	<noscript>
		<p><b>Please enable JavaScript to see the super secret message!</b></p>
	</noscript>
</body>
</html>
```

* Script is enclosed in `script` tags.
* Alternative HTML is enclosed in `noscript` tags.

## Types
JavaScript is a dynamically and loosely typed language. It has five different types:

* `boolean`
* `number`
	* This is both integers and floating point numbers are treated the same.
	* We can use the `Math` object (`Math.log()`) to do mathematical functions.
* `string`
* `function`
* `object`

We can find the type of an object like so:

```javascript
document.writeln("Type of 23.0: " + typeof(23.0));
```

### Typecasting
We can cast types by wrapping them in an appropriate object from:

* `Number()`
* `String()`
* `Boolean()`

We can also process specifically as an int or float:

* `parseInt()`
* `parseFloat()`

## Strings
We can write strings like so:

```javascript
document.writeln("Your name is " + name + "and\
	you are studying " + degree + "\
	at " + university);
```

## Variables
Variables can be declared like so:

```javascript
var variable1 = value, variable2 = value2, ...
```

If you don't initialise a variable before using it you will get a **reference error**.
