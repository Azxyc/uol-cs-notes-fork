## Control Structures
### Conditional Statements
Conditional statements can take the following forms:

```javascript
if (condition)
	statement
else if (condition)
	statement
else
	statement
```

```javascript
condition ? if_true_expr : if_false_expr
```

### Switch Statements
We can use `switch` statements like so:

```javascript
switch (expr) {
	case expr1:
		statements
		break;
	case expr2:
		statements
		break;
	default:
		statements
		break;
}
```
### `while` & `do` `while` Loops
We can use these two different types of `while` loop like so:

```javascript
while (condition)
	statement
```

```javascript
do
	statement
while (condition)
```

### For Loops
We can write `for` loops with the following syntax:

```javascript
for (i = 1, j = 1; j >= 0; i++, j--)
	document.writeln(i = " * " + j + " = " + i*j)
```

Variables declared in the `for` loop are still visible outside the loop. We can use `let`, instead of `var`, to declare a variable that is local to a block.

### `break` & `continue`
We can use these statements in a loop to modify the program flow:

* `break` - Stops execution of the loop and continues with the rest of the program.
* `continue` - Stops execution of the current iteration of the loop and skips to the next iteration.

### Error Handling
When a JavaScript statement generates an error, an exception is thrown. We can use the following structure to handle this behaviour:

```javascript
x = "A"
try {
	if (isNaN(x)) throw "x is NaN"
	y = x.toFixed(2)
} catch (e) {
	document.writeln("Caught: " + e)
	y = 0
} finally {
	document.writeln("y = ", y)
}
```

You can also see that we can use `throw` to generate exceptions.

## Arrays
An array is created by assigning an array value to a variable:

```javascript
var arrayVar = [elem0, elem1, ...]
```

We can find the length of an array like so:

```javascript
var length = arrayVar.length
```

Assigning a value to `arrayVar.length` will extend, or shrink, the array to this new length.

We can return a copy of any array by using the `slice` function:

```javascript
var newArray = arrayVar.slice(start, end)
```

This can be useful as, by default, arrays are passed by reference.

### Other Array Operators
JavaScript has no `stack` or `queue` data structures. We do have the following functions though:

| Function | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `array.push(value1, value2, ...)` | Appends one or more elements to the end of an array. Returns the number of elements in the resulting array. |
| `array.pop()` | Extracts the last element from an array and returns it. | 
| `array.shift()` | Extracts the first element of an array and returns it. |
| `array.unshift(value1, value2, ...)` | Inserts one or more elements at the start of an array variable. Returns the number of elements in the resulting array. |

### Iterating on Arrays
The recommended way to iterate over all elements of an array is a `for` loop:

```javascript
for (i = 0; i < arrayVar.length; i++) {
	... arrayVar[i] ...
}
```

We can also use the `forEach` method like so:

```javascript
var callback = function (elem, index, arrayArg) {
	statements
}
arrayVer.forEach(callback);
```

* The `forEach` method takes a function as an argument.
* It iterates over all elements of the array.
* It  passes the current array element `elem`, to the current index `index` and a pointer to the array `arrayArg` to the function.
* Return value of that function is ignored.
