> Computer-aided software engineering is the application of computer-assisted tools and methods in software development to ensure a high-quality and defect-free software.

## Why Tools are Used
Software tools are used for the following reasons:

* Productivity Cost
* Accuracy
* Quality
* Safety

When CASE is used properly:

* You will become a better software engineer.
* You will work better with others.
* Your code will be tested more.
* You will do things you wouldn't normally bother to do.
	* Refactoring code.
* Your life in software engineering will be slightly less stressful.

CASE tools can be:

* **General Purpose**:
	* Build and test tools.
		* Language agnostic.
* **Specialist**:
	* Load testing
	* DoS tool
		* Low Orbit Ion Cannon
		
## Evolution of CASE

1. **Machine Language**
	* No real CASE.
1. **Assembly Language**
	* Still no checks
	* All abstraction in the programmer's head.
1. **High Level Language Compilers**
	* Abstractions are part of the language.
	* Code is capable of:
		* Being structured.
		* Being tested as part of compilation.
1. **Interpreters**
	
	Programs can be:
	
	* Source Code Based
		* Fast turnaround time.
		* No pre-compile check.
		* Only checks running code.
	* Intermediary Code Based
		* Slower turnaround time.
		* Supports pre-compile checks.
		* Allow for multiple languages to be converted to the same intermediate language.

## CASE Tools
### Programming Tools

1. Machine Language
1. Assembler
1. Compiler
1. Interpreter

* IDEs
	* Editing tools.

### Testing & Debugging Tools

* Debuggers
	* Generally focused on specific programming languages.
* Logic Analysers
* Profiler
	* View where time is spend running your code.
* Logger

* Wikis
* Cost estimation tools.

### Design Development Tools

* UML Editors
* Code Generators
* Reverse Engineering
* Database ORM Tools
	* Allow you to test on database object data.
