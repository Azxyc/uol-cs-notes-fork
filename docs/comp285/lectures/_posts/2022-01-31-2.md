title: In-Circuit Emulator (ICE) Debugging
tags: COMP285 Lectures
---
This does all the functions of a software debugger but at the machine instruction level.

* ICE replaces the CPU in the target motherboard.
* Very useful for embedded debugging:
	* Smartphones
	* DVD Players
	
### ICE Features

* Breakpoint before instruction execution.
* Breakpoint on complex conditions:
	* Write particular data value to a memory location.
	* Write and read from I/O.
	* Hardware interrupts.

There are some **differences** to software debuggers:

* Faster
	* Runs at full CPU speed.
* Can break on a full range of hardware conditions at the CPU level.
	* Register access.
