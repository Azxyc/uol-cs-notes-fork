## Boundary Testing
This is where we test:

* One **Above**
* One **Below**

and **on** the value of a **boundary**.

## Partition Testing
Tests should only test a **single** possible bug. 

For example we could have two tests:

1. One if the input is too **long**.
1. One if the input is too **short**.

We should **never** have a case where **both tests fail** at the same time.

These two cases are called **partitions**.

## Exhaustive Testing
If it is possible then we should test **all** possible inputs (7 days of the week).
