title: Testing Principles

* Testing shows the **presence** of errors; not their absence.
* **Exhaustive** testing is not practical in **most** cases.
* Test early and regularly to avoid **bug masking** and **multiple defect relations**.
* Errors are not evenly distributed:
	* 20% of modules generally contain 80% of errors.
	
## Pesticide Paradox
Unless tests change they often **become invalid** - as the functionality changes so should the tests:

* If we continue to use old tests, only buts associated with the old specification are removed.

## Context Dependency
We should focus our testing on the **most critical type of test**, for example:

* **Medical System** - Safety Testing
* **Website** - Performance and Load Testing

## Types of Testing
We can include the following types of tests:

* Verification (Against the Specification)
* Validation (Right for the Customer)
* Performance
* Security
* Usability
* Regulatory Testing
* Statistical Testing
