This is where each range of data (not every combination of data) is tested. We are trying to test only a single attribute at a time.

### Modes of Error
The mode of an error is how many parts of a function have errors in them. Consider that we have the following function that counts the days until a certain date:

```java
countDaysTill(int day, int month, int year)
```

We could have bugs appear when we check different variables of the input:

* Bug in `year` - Single Mode Fault
* Buy in `day` and `year` - Double Mode Fault

Exhaustive testing of some single mode faults is sometimes possible.

### Visualising Orthogonal Testing
When there is a large amount of data to test we can visualise this in a 3D graph for 3 variables. We can then see where the errors occur on the input.
