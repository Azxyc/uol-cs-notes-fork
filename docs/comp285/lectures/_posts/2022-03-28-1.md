title: Refactoring
tags: COMP285 Lectures

Refactoring is where we **improve our code quality** while maintaining the **same functionality**. This yields better:

* Readability
* Testing
* OO Structure
* Re-usability
* Efficiency
* Extend-ability

## Code Smell
These are issues with the code that **aren't bugs**. They are bad coding practices:

* **Duplicated Code**
	* We should use generalised classes that we can extend if we need similar, but different, functionality.
* **Long Methods**
	* We should split long methods into functions to aid code reuse.
* **Long Argument Lists**
	* Collections of data should be wrapped in a type.
	* Data that required validation should have it's own type so that invalid data can never be passed to a function.
* **Large Classes**
	* Make sure we are using super-classes properly.
	* Generalise functions (pull-up), or specialise (push-down).
		* When generalising methods see if making an interface would be appropriate.
* **Excessively Long Identifiers**
* **Excessively Short Identifiers**
* **Inappropriate Intimacy**
	* Where one class writes data directly into another classes attribute.
	* We should avoid having any `public` attributes.
