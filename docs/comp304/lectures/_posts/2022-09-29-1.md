## Language
This is what defines a well formed formula (wff) in a particular logic.

We start with a set $\mathcal P$ of atoms, $\mathcal P = p, q, p_1, p_2,\ldots$
: These represent basic facts that we don't analyse further.

The atoms determine the level of detail that we consider.

### Well Formed Formulas

* Every $p\in \mathcal P$ is a wff.
* If $\phi$ and $\psi$ are wffs, then $\neg\phi,(\phi\wedge\psi),(\phi\vee\psi), (\phi\implies\psi),(\phi\iff\psi)$
	* Each wff includes these brackets.
	* **Negation binds stronger** than other connectives as it is **unary**.
* We can omit brackets if this does not cause ambiguity.

## Validity
Contingent Formulas
: This is the case if you can change whether a formula is true or false by changing the inputs.

Valid Formulas $\vDash\phi$
: Formulas where only true is returned, no matter the input.

	You can also write this as $\emptyset\vDash\phi$.
	{:.info}

Valid Inference $\{p,q\}\vDash p\wedge q$
: This is where a set of premises guarantee the truth of the conclusion.

### Truth Tables
To find whether an inference is true then we can draw a truth table for all the premises:

$\{p,p\implies q\}\vdash q$

| $p$ | $q$ | $p$ | $p\implies q$ | $q$ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

We can then use the table to prove by example/counterexample.

### Proof System
#### Axioms of Propositional Logic

| Name | Axiom |
| :-- | :-- |
| $(\implies1)$ | $\phi\implies(\psi\implies\phi)$ |
| $(\implies2)$ | $(\phi\implies(\chi\implies\psi))\implies((\phi\implies\chi)\implies(\phi\implies\psi))$ |
| $(\wedge1)$ | $(\phi\wedge\psi)\implies\phi$ |
| $(\wedge2)$ | $(\phi\wedge\psi)\implies\psi$ |
| $(\wedge3)$ | $\phi\implies(\psi\implies(\phi\implies\psi))$ |
| $(\vee1)$ | $\phi\implies(\phi\vee\psi)$ |
| $(\vee2)$ | $\psi\implies(\phi\vee\psi)$ |
| $(\vee3)$ | $((\phi\implies\chi)\wedge(\psi\implies\chi))\implies((\phi\vee\psi)\implies\chi)$ |
| $(\neg1)$ | $((\phi\implies\psi)\wedge(\phi\implies\neg\psi))\implies\neg\phi$ |
| $(\neg2)$ | $(\phi\wedge\neg\phi)\implies\psi$ |
| $(\neg3)$ | $\phi\wedge\neg\phi$ |
| $(\iff1)$ | $(\phi\iff\psi)\implies(\phi\implies\psi)$ |
| $(\iff2)$ | $(\phi\iff\psi)\implies(\psi\implies\phi)$ |
| $(\iff3)$ | $((\phi\implies\psi)\wedge(\psi\implies\phi))\implies(\phi\iff\psi)$ |

#### Derivation
You can use the following justifications to form your derivation:

* It is a **premise**.
* It is an instance of an **axiom**.
* If we have derived $\phi$ and $\phi\implies\psi$ then we can use $\psi$.
	
	This is the rule MP.
	{:.info}
	
By combining our derivations (MP) and the axioms we can create a proof system $\mathfrak P$
	
#### Proof Example
$\Gamma\vdash_\mathfrak P\phi$ if $\phi$ can be derived $\Gamma$ in $\mathfrak P$.

For example we can prove the commutativity of $\wedge$:

$$
p\wedge q\vdash q\wedge p
$$

| Step | Derivation | Justification |
| :-: | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | $p\wedge q$ | premise |
| 2 | $(p\wedge q)\implies p$ | $(\wedge1)$ |
| 3 | $(p\wedge q)\implies q$ | $(\wedge2)$ |
| 4 | $p$ | (MP) on 1 and 2 |
| 5 | $q$ | (MP) on 1 and 3 |
| 6 | $q\implies(p\implies(q\wedge p))$ | $(\wedge3)$ |
| 7 | $p\implies(q\wedge p)$ | (MP) on 5 and 6 |
| 8 | $q\wedge p$ | (MP) on 4 and 7 |

#### Soundness and Completeness

* If $\Gamma\vdash_\mathfrak P \phi$, then $\Gamma\vDash\phi$. So we can only derive **valid** inferences.
	* This is called **soundness**.
* If $\Gamma\vDash\phi$, then $\Gamma\vdash_\mathfrak P\phi$. So every valid inference can be **derived**. 
	* This is called **completeness**.
	
A proof system is only considered **useful** if it is sound and complete.

This is to say we want our **proof system** $\mathfrak P$ to be complete and inline with the logics of mathematics.

### Abbreviations
#### $\bot$ and $\top$

* $\top$ represents something that is always true (such as $p\vee\neg p$)
* $\bot$ represents something that is always false (such as $p\wedge\neg p$)

#### $\wedge$, $\implies$ and $\iff$
We can also define some of our connectives as abbreviations:

* $\phi\wedge\psi$ can abbreviate $\neg(\neg\psi\vee\neg\psi)$
* $\phi\implies\psi$ can abbreviate $\neg\phi\vee\psi$
* $\phi\iff\psi$ can abbreviate $(\phi\implies\psi)\wedge(\phi\implies\psi)$

## Language Definition
As we can abbreviate our original atoms: $\neg,\vee,\wedge,\implies,\iff$ we can **redefine** the **language** of propositional logic as:

$$
\phi::=p\mid\neg\phi\mid\phi\vee\phi
$$

<div class="info">
Formerly it would have been:

$$
\phi::=p\mid\neg\phi\mid\phi\vee\phi\mid\phi\wedge\phi\mid\phi\implies\phi\mid\phi\iff\phi
$$
</div>
