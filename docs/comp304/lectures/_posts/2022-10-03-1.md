## Truth-Functionality
The connectives of **propositional logic** are truth-functional:

* This means that the truth of $\phi\wedge\psi$ is fully determined by the truth of $\phi$ and $\psi$.

If a proposition is not truth-functional we can describe it like so:

$$
\phi = 
\begin{cases}
p & \text{That happens to be true}\\
\top & \text{That is always true}
\end{cases}
$$

We are not sure whether $\phi$ will continue to be true.

## Language of Modal Logic
In modal logic we have an extra unary connective:

$$
\phi::=p\mid\neg\phi\mid\phi\wedge\phi\mid\square\phi
$$

$\lozenge\phi$ is an abbreviation for $\neg\square\neg\phi$.

### The Meaning of $\square$
$\square \phi$ has many meanings depending on the circumstance:

| Circumstance | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| Alethic | $\phi$ is necessarily true |
| Epistemic | I know that $\phi$ is true |
| Doxastic | I believe that $\phi$ is true |
| Temporal | At every time in the future, $\phi$ will be true |
| Denotic | $\phi$ should be true |
| Legal | $\phi$ is legally required to be true |

### The Meaning of $\lozenge$
$\lozenge \phi$ has many meanings depending on the circumstance:

| Circumstance | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| Alethic | $\phi$ is possibly true |
| Epistemic | As far as I know, $\phi$ might be true |
| Doxastic | I believe that $\phi$ might be true |
| Temporal | At some time in the future, $\phi$ will be true |
| Denotic | $\phi$ is allowed to be true |
| Legal | it is legal for $\phi$ to be true |

## Converting Language to Modal Logic
### Modal Logic to English Examples

* Temporal: $\square\lozenge p$:
	* At every point in the future, $p$ will be true some late time.
* Deontic: $\square p\implies\lozenge p$:
	* If $p$ is mandatory then it is also permitted.
* Legal: $\neg\lozenge\square\neg p$:
	* It is not permitted to forbid $p$.
* Epistemic: $\square p\implies\square\square p$:
	* If I know $p$, then I know that I know $p$.
	
### English to Modal Logic Examples

* "I know that Today is Thursday":
	* $p=\text{today is Thursday}$
	* $\square p$
* "If it it legal to walk here then is it legal to stand here":
	* $p=\text{walk here}$
	* $q=\text{stand here}$
	* $\lozenge p\implies\lozenge q$

There are also quotes which can be parsed multiple ways:

* "**I know that it is Monday** or it is Tuesday":
	* $\square p\vee q$
* "I know that **it is Monday or it is Tuesday**":
	* $\square (p\vee q)$
	
When translating an ambiguous sentence to logic, choose a disambiguation. All disambiguations will be acceptable in the exam.
