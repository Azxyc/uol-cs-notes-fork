## Truth-Functionality
The connectives of **propositional logic** are truth-functional:

* This means that the truth of $\phi\wedge\psi$ is fully determined by the truth of $\phi$ and $\psi$.

If a proposition is not truth-functional we can describe it like so:

$$
\phi = 
\begin{cases}
p & \text{That happens to be true}\\
\top & \text{That is always true}
\end{cases}
$$

We are not sure whether $\phi$ will continue to be true.

## Language of Modal Logic
In modal logic we have an extra unary connective:

$$
\phi::=p\mid\neg\phi\mid\phi\wedge\phi\mid\square\phi
$$

$\lozenge\phi$ is an abbreviation for $\neg\square\neg\phi$.

### The Meaning of $\square$
$\square \phi$ has many meanings depending on the circumstance:

| Circumstance | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| Alethic | $\phi$ is necessarily true |
| Epistemic | I know that $\phi$ is true |
| Doxastic | I believe that $\phi$ is true |
| Temporal | At every time in the future, $\phi$ will be true |
| Denotic | $\phi$ should be true |
| Legal | $\phi$ is legally required to be true |

### The Meaning of $\lozenge$
$\lozenge \phi$ has many meanings depending on the circumstance:

| Circumstance | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| Alethic | $\phi$ is possibly true |
| Epistemic | As far as I know, $\phi$ might be true |
| Doxastic | I believe that $\phi$ might be true |
| Temporal | At every time in the future, $\phi$ will be true |
| Denotic | $\phi$ is allowed to be true |
| Legal | it is legal for $\phi$ to be true |
