## Language of Multi-Agent Modal Logic
Currently we can say $\square\square\phi$ "I know that I know that $\phi$". If we want to say "I know that you know that $\phi$", with multiple agents, then we can annotate our boxes to define who knows what.

To define this, we can use the following:

* A set $\mathcal P=\{p,p_1,\ldots,p_n\}$ of propositional atoms.
* A set $\mathcal A=\{a,b,c,\ldots,a_n,b_n,c_n\}$ of agents

Therefore the language of multi-modal logic is:

$$
\phi::=p\mid\neg\phi\mid\phi\wedge\phi\mid\square_a\phi
$$

## Multi-Agent Models
These are very similar to single-agent models, however each relation has a label for which agents that relation is valid. We can define this as:

Multi-Agent Model: $M=(W,R,V)$ where:

* $W$ is a set of worlds
* $R=\{R_a\mid a\in\mathcal A\}$
* For every agent $a\in\mathcal A,R_a\subseteq W\times W$ is a relation
* $V$ is a valuation

### Example Multi-Agent Model
We can write a multi-agent model like so:

* $W=\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}$
* $R_a=\{(w_1,w_2),(w_3,w_1)\}$
* $R_b=\{(w_1,w_2),(w_3,w_1),(w_3,w_2)\}$
* $V(p)=\{w_1\}$

We should, specify relations for all agents, and the valuation for every atom. If we don't specify them, they are assumed to be empty.

We can merge the arrows and write the agents in a comma separated list.

## Semantics of Multi-Agent Modal Logic
If $M=(M,R,V)$ is a multi-agents model and $w\in R$, then you determine whether $\phi$ holds $M,w$ in the following way:

* $M,w\vDash p$ if and only if $w\in V(p)$
* $M,w\vDash\neg\phi$ if and only if $M,w\nvDash \phi$
* $M,w\vDash\phi_1\wedge\phi_2$ if and only if $M,w\vDash\phi_1$ and $M,w\vDash\phi_2$
* $M,w\vDash\square_a\phi$ if and only if, for every $w_2$ such that $(w,w_2)\in R_a$, we have $M,w_2\vDash\phi$
	
	The only difference here is that we verify $\square$ and $\lozenge$ only against relations defined by that agent.

If $(w,w_2)\in R_a$ then $w_2$ is called an $a$-successor of $w$.

Therefore $\square_a\phi$ holds in $w$ if and only if $\phi$ holds in every $a$-successor of $w$.
