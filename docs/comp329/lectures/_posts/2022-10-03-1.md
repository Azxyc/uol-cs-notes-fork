This is the process of using **simple rules** to create **complex behaviours**.

## Steel's Mars Explorer System
Consider that we have a robot that we want to explore a distant planet and collect samples of rock. We know that the locations of the rocks tend to be clustered.

We can use the following rules from lowest to highest priority:

1. If true, move randomly.
1. If detect a sample then pick the sample up.
1. If carrying a sample and not at the base, then travel up gradient.
	
	The **gradient** is a radio signal emitted by the mother-ship.

1. If carrying a sample and at the base, then drop the sample.
1. If detect an obstacle, then change direction.

### Stigmergy
This is a act of communicating by leaving signs in the environment.

We can include this behaviour in our system to allow multiple agents to communicate and locate clusters of rock:

3\. If carrying sample and not at the base, then drop 2 crumbs and travel up the gradient.

4.5\. If sense crumbs, then pick up one crumb and travel down the gradient. 

A **crumb** is a detectable piece of radioactive material.
