## Typical Motion Models
Typically there are two types of motion model:

Odometry-based
: Used when systems are equipped with proprioceptive sensors such as wheel encoders.

Velocity-based (Dead reckoning)
: Used based purely on velocities and time elapsed, using no sensors.

## Classification of Sensors
### Proprioceptive Sensors
Measure **values internally**, measuring direct feedback on the robot. This can include:

* Wheel Encoders
* Motor Load

### Exteroceptive Sensors
Measure **values from the environment**. These can be:

* Ambient light sensors
* Radar

### Passive Sensors
Measure **energy from the environment**, have no external effect. They can include:

* Accelerometers
* Thermometers

### Active Sensors
**Emit their own energy** and measure the reaction. These include:

* IR emitters
* Sonar

## Coping with Errors
In general odometry doesn't hold up well over long distances:

Range Error
: Integrated path length (distance) of the robots movement.
	
	Sum of the wheel movements.
	{:.info}

Drift Error
: Difference in the error of the wheels leads to an error in the robot's angular orientation.

Turn Error
: Similar to range error, but for turns.

	Difference of the wheel motions.

Over long periods of time, turn and drift errors far outweigh range errors.

## Relative Odometry
We can encode a **position** like so:

$$
\langle x,y,\theta\rangle
$$

Where $x$ and $y$ are the Cartesian coordinates and $\theta$ is the direction the robot is facing:

We can write our **believed position** as $\langle \bar x,\bar y,\bar\theta\rangle$. This is opposed to the **true location** which is written as $\langle \hat x,\hat y,\hat\theta\rangle$
{:.info}

Odometry is the difference between two poses:

$$
u=\langle\delta_\text{rot1},\delta_\text{trans},\delta_{rot2}\rangle
$$

where:

$$
\begin{align}
\delta_\text{rot1}&=\text{atan2} (y'-y,x'-x)-\theta\\
\delta_\text{trans}&=\sqrt{(x-x')^2+(y-y')^2}\\
\delta_\text{rot2}&=\theta'-\theta-\delta_\text{rot1}
\end{align}
$$

$\text{atan2}$ is defined as so:

$$
\text{atan2}(y,x) = \begin{cases}
\arctan(\frac yx)&\text{if }x>0\\
\text{sign}(y)(\pi-\arctan(\lvert \frac yx\rvert))&\text{if }x<0\\
0&\text{if }x=y=0\\
\text{sign}(y)\frac\pi2&\text{if }x=0,y\neq0
\end{cases}
$$

### Odometry Model
What is the likelihood that $u_t$ took us from $\bar x_{t-1}$ to $\bar x_t$?

Where $\bar x_{t-1}$ and $x_t$ are our believed location before and after respectively.

We can determine the **true odometry** $\hat u_t$ via a model:

* We are trying to determine $p(\hat u_t\mid u_t)$ which can be solved by determining $p(x_t\mid u_t,x_{t-1})$, where:
	* new location/state: $\text{pose}(x_t)$
	* the motion/action: $\text{odometry}(u_t)$
	* original location/state: $\text{pose}(x_{t-1})$

### Model for Odometry with Noise
To calculate the true motion we should account for independent noise. We can do this using six coefficients $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_6$. These can be calculated using sampling.

#### Noisy Initial Rotation

$$
\hat\delta_\text{rot1} = \delta_\text{rot1}+\epsilon_{\alpha_1\lvert\delta_\text{rot1}\rvert+\alpha_2\lvert\delta_\text{trans}\rvert}
$$

Note that we take the absolute value using $\lvert x\rvert$. This doesn't mean *given that*.
{:.info}

where:

* $\alpha_1$ - possibly due to error on the inital rotation.
* $\alpha_2$ - possibly due to forces on the robot as it moves forward.

#### Noisy Translational Error

$$
\hat\delta_\text{trans}=\delta_\text{trans}+\epsilon_{\alpha_3\lvert\delta_\text{trans}\rvert+\alpha_4\lvert\delta_\text{rot1}+\delta_\text{rot2}\rvert}
$$

where:

* $\alpha_3$ - possibly due to error with the translation.
* $\alpha_4$ - initial and final rotation can result in a drift in position.

#### Noisy Final Rotation

$$
\hat\delta_\text{rot2}=\delta_\text{rot2}+\epsilon_{\alpha_5\lvert\delta_\text{rot2}\rvert+\alpha_6\lvert\delta_\text{trans}\rvert}
$$

where:

* $\alpha_5$ - possibly due to error on the final rotation.
* $\alpha_6$ - possibly due to the resulting translational movement that may further rotate the robot.

Many models assume that the initial and final rotations have similar characteristics and assume $\alpha_5=\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_6=\alpha_2$.

#### Modelling $\epsilon$

* We can use a Gaussian (normal distribution):
	
	$$
	\epsilon_{\sigma^2}(x)=\frac1{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}
	$$
* We can use a triangular distribution as a fast approximation:
	
	$$
	\epsilon_{\sigma^2}(x)=\begin{cases}0&\text{if }\lvert x\rvert>\sqrt{6\sigma^2}\\\frac{\sqrt{6\sigma^2}-\lvert x\rvert}{6\sigma^2}\end{cases}
	$$
	
The distributions have a zero-centred mean, and $b=\sigma=\text{standard deviation}$.
