## Typical Motion Models
Typically there are two types of motion model:

Odometry-based
: Used when systems are equipped with proprioceptive sensors such as wheel encoders.

Velocity-based (Dead reckoning)
: Used based purely on velocities and time elapsed, using no sensors.

## Classification of Sensors
### Proprioceptive Sensors
Measure **values internally**, measuring direct feedback on the robot. This can include:

* Wheel Encoders
* Motor Load

### Exteroceptive Sensors
Measure **values from the environment**. These can be:

* Ambient light sensors
* Radar

### Passive Sensors
Measure **energy from the environment**, have no external effect. They can include:

* Accelerometers
* Thermometers

### Active Sensors
**Emit their own energy** and measure the reaction. These include:

* IR emitters
* Sonar

## Coping with Errors
In general odometry doesn't hold up well over long distances:

Range Error
: Integrated path length (distance) of the robots movement.
	
	Sum of the wheel movements.
	{:.info}

Drift Error
: Difference in the error of the wheels leads to an error in the robot's angular orientation.

Turn Error
: Similar to range error, but for turns.

	Difference of the wheel motions.
	{:.info}
	
Over long periods of time, turn and drift errors far outweigh range errors.
