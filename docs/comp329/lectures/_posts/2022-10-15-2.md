## Exteroceptive Sensors
This is a class of sensors that measure information about a robot's external environment. They are characterised by a number of different attributes:

### Field of View & Range
Every sensor has a region of space that it can cover:

* The width of that region is the field of view $\beta$
* The range $R$ is how far the field of view extends.

### Sensor Performance

Sensitivity
: Measure of the degree to which incremental changes in the target input change the output signal.
	
	The ratio of output change to input change.
	{:.info}

Cross-sensitivity
: Sensitivity to environmental parameters that are orthogonal to the target parameters.
	
	An example is that a compass is sensitive to magnetic north, but also to ferrous materials.

#### Accuracy & Precision

Accuracy (Error)
: Difference between the sensor's measured value, $m$ and the true value $v$, such that:

	$$
	\begin{align}
	\text{error}&=m-v\\
	\text{accuracy}&=1-\frac{\lvert m-v\rvert}v
	\end{align}
	$$

Precision
: Reproducibility sensor results. If the random error of a sensor is characterised by some mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, the the precision is the ration of the sensors output range to $\sigma$.

#### Systematic & Random Error

Systematic errors are deterministic:

* Caused by factors that can be modelled and corrected.

Random errors are non-deterministic:

* No prediction is possible.
* They can be described probabilistically, like errors in wheel odometry.

### Resolution, Linearity & Frequency

Resolution
: The minimum difference between two values.

Bandwidth (Frequency)
: The speed which which a sensor can provide readings. 

### Responsiveness
Most sensors work poorly in certain domains. Therefore we should use sensors that have a good signal-to-noise ratio in their application.

For example, sonar works poorly in environments with large amounts of glass due to the large amount of specular reflection.

## Behavioural Sensor Function
Sensor Fusion
: The combination of information from multiple sensors into a single percept.

We want to use multiple sensors for the following reasons:

* Redundancy
* Complementary - Difference percepts that support each-other.
	* Touch sensors when objects are too close to be detected by sonar.
* Coordinated - Using one sensor as a consequence of a percept detected by another.
	* Detecting a possible obstacle using a range sensor and verifying it's existence using a tactile sensor.

| Feature Exists | True Positive | False Negative |
| Nothing to Perceive | False Positive | True Negative |

### Sensor Fusion 
Sensor fusion ca be combined with behaviours in different ways:

* Sensor Fission
	* One sensor per behaviour.
	* Behaviours can share sensor streams.

	s3[sensor] -->|percept| b3[behaviour] -->|action| cm[combination mechanism]
	cm -->|action| x(( ))
	```

* Action-Oriented Sensor Fusion
	* The combination of sensor data may trigger different different behaviours.
	* An abstract percept emerges form the fusion of several percepts.
