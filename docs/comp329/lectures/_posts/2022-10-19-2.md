The aim of the sensor model is to determine:

$$
P(z\mid x)
$$

what is the probability of a measurement $z$, given that the robot is in state $x$.

## Beam-Based Sensor Model
Consider each beam from the robot's sensors independently. A **scan** $z$ is made up of $K$ measurements:

$$
z=\{z_1, \ldots,z_K\}
$$

Individual measurements are independent given the robot position:

$$
P(z\mid x, m)=\prod^k_{k=1}P(z_k\mid x, m)
$$

This assumes that we already have a map.

We may get the following types of erroneous readings:

* Measurement Noise
* Unexpected Obstacles
* Random Measurements
* Max Range

We can then combine these to form a combined distribution such that we can determine:

$$
P(z\mid x,m)
$$

This will be different depending on the type of erronious reading.

### Measurement Noise
We can calculate this as:

$$
P_\text{hit}=\eta\frac1{\sqrt{2\pi b}}e^{-\frac12\frac{(z-z_\text{exp})^2}{b}}
$$

Consider we calculate an expected sensor value $z_\text{exp}$. We can calculate:

$$
p(z\mid z_\text{exp})
$$

as the distribution is limited to $[0,z_\max]$, we normalise with:

$$
\eta=\left(\int^{z_\max}_0\frac1{\sqrt{2\pi b}}e^{-\frac12\frac{(z-z_\text{exp})^2}{b}}dz^k_t\right)^{-1}
$$

### Unexpected Obsticles

We can model this with the following distribution:

$$
P_\text{unexp}=\begin{cases}\eta\lambda e^{-\lambda z}&z<z_\text{exp}\\0&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}
$$

where $\lambda>0$ is the rate paramter and $z$ is the query point.

As the exponential range is limited to $[0,z]$, we normalise with:

$$
\eta=\frac1{1-e^{\lambda z}}
$$

### Max Range
We can model this with the following distribution:

$$
P_\text{max}=\begin{cases}1&z=z_\max\\0&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}
$$

### Resulting Mixture Density
We can combine this by calculating the weighted sum of all the distributions:

$$
P(z\mid x, m)=\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha_\text{hit}\\
\alpha_\text{unexp}\\
\alpha_\max\\
\alpha_\text{rand}
\end{pmatrix}^T\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}
P_\text{hit}(z\mid x, m)\\
P_\text{unexp}(z\mid x, m)\\
P_\text{max}(z\mid x, m)\\
P_\text{rand}(z\mid x, m)\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

#### Determining Intrinsic Values
The sensor model is tuned through a set of intrinsic values:

$$
\Theta=\langle\alpha_\text{hit}, \alpha_\text{unexp}, \alpha_\max, \alpha_\text{rand}, \sigma, \lambda\rangle
$$

This consists of the **weights** where:

$$
\alpha_\text{hit}+ \alpha_\text{unexp}+ \alpha_\max+ \alpha_\text{rand}=1
$$

and the **distribution parameters**:

* $\lambda$ for the exponential distribution
	* The probability when $z=0$.
* $\sigma$ for the normal distribution
	* The width of the Gaussian.
