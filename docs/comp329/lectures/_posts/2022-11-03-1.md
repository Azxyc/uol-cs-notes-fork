## Types of Navigation
### Global Navigation
This is about deciding how to get from some start point to a goal point:

* The robot plans in some sense.
* This plan consists of a series of waypoints.


### Local Navigation
This is about obstacle avoidance:

* We can use sensors to ensure that we don't hit an object on the way to a waypoint.

## Configuration Space

Configuration space (or Cspace) defines how much space a robot should leave between itself and any obstacle:

* We can use a circle around the centre of the robot to the further point on the robot to represent this.

This assumes that the robot can turn on the spot (holonomic).

## Voronoi Diagrams
A Voronoi diagram defines barriers around a set of points:

We can extend this to objects to generate paths that stay equidistant from objects.

## Bushfire Planning
This calculates the distance to the nearest obstacle:

* Approximates the repulsive function for a potential field.
* Neighbours are either 4 point or 8 point connectivity.

We can calculate the grid like so:

1. Label all empty cells as 0, and occupied cells as 1.
1. Assume $i=1$
1. For each cell neighbouring a cell with the value $i$, label it with $i+1$.
1. Repeat until all cells have a non-zero value.

We can then compute paths by following the gradient around the map.

Higher numbers are more attractive cells.

## Topological Maps
Topological maps record:

* Nodes - Representing areas in the world.
* Arcs - Representing adjacency and traversability between nodes.

By making a map into a graph, we can use graph searching algorithms to finds routes around a space.

### Topological Map Types

Topological:

* Route based.
* Express space in terms of connections between landmarks.
* Orientation cues are egocentric.

Quantitative:

* Layout based.
* Independent of the robot pose.

## Search
With grid based maps we can consider each cell as a node with $N4$ or $N8$ connectivity.

To find the way to a destination we will need to search the map for a route. To do this we can use the following search techniques:

* Naive searches:
	* Depth-first Search
	* Breadth-first Search
* Heuristic Searches:
	* Dijkstra's Shortest Path
	* Greedy Best-first Search
		
		This is much faster than Dijkstra's but is suboptimal and can be lured into local minima.
		{:.info}
	* A* Search
	* D* Search
		
		This is a version of A* that keeps track of the search that led to a plan and only fixes the errors. This is faster than replanning from scratch.

	* Wavefront Planning

### Waypoints
As we find a route we should record waypoints, typically at the centre of each cell.
