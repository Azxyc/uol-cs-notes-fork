This is where we model the world as a 2D or 3D array. We can then store the probability that we are in any one location in this array.


## Piecewise Constant Representation
Markov localisation utilised a probability distribution across all states:

* Represented as $\text{Bel}(x_t)$ for each $x_t$.

We can model this **discretely** as a histogram (bins):

* If there are $N$ rooms, then we can model this as:
	
	$$
	p(n)\forall n\in N
	$$

The sum over all bins should be:

$$
\sum x_t=1
$$

We can then calculate like so:

1. Start with a uniform distribution (if the location is unknown), or bounded Gaussian (if a location is known).
1. The robot observes a feature:
	* The Initial belief is proportional to the observation likelihood.
	* The histogram then represents likely locations of the robot using:
	
		$$
		P(z_t\mid x_t)
		$$
1. The robot now moves:
	* We convolve out current distribution with our motion model.
	* This translates the histogram and smooths peaks.
	* This is represented as:
	
		$$
		\sum_{x_{t-1}}P(x_t\mid u_t,x_{t-1})Bel(x_{t-1})
		$$
1. The final distribution is the product of the observation model and resulting distribution with the shifted motion model:
	
	$$
	Bel(x_t)=\eta P(z_t\mid x_t)\sum_{x_{t-1}}P(x_t\mid u_t,x_{t-1})Bel(x_{t-1})
	$$
	
	$\eta$ is a normalisation factor that ensures $\sum x_t=1$.
