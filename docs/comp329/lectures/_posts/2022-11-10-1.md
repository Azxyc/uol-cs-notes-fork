Markov localisation is very computationally and memory intensive as all the bins have to be updated.

* Particle filters use sampling techniques to reduce the number of possible positions, and number of calculations.

We can describe the method like so:

1. Given a space, generate randomly, a set of particles that generate a hypothesis for where the robot.
	
	Particles have a location and rotation (pose).

1. Cull particles who's observations don't correlate with the current robot's observations. These particles have low weight.
1. For each particles that is culled, resample the space to find a location with greater likelihood.
