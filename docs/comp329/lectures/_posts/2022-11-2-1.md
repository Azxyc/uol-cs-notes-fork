title: Connecting Features

Features correspond to artefacts in the environment.:

* These may be obstacles that we need to avoid.
* Can also be beacons that aid in localisation.

There are several formas a feature might take but it will depend on:

* What sensors the robot has.
* What features can be extracted.

## Map
Once we have a set of features we can build a map:

* A map states how features sit relative to one another.

### Types of Map
#### Metric Maps

* Gives the precise location of the features:
	* Frequently expressed as a pose $\langle x, y,\theta\rangle$.
* Most implementation assume a 2D representation to avoid computational explosion.
* Typically make a **closed world** assumption:
	
	If a feature is not specified then there is nothing there.

The total storage required is proportional to the density of objects in the environment.

##### Representing Metric Maps
Formally, a map is a list of objects and their properties:

$$
m = \{m_1,\ldots,m_N\}
$$

where each $m_n$ with $1\leq n\leq N$ specifies a property.

#### Cell/Grid Based Maps
Another way to create a map is to decompose the map into cells within a grid. 
##### Exact Cell Decomposition
We can segment the space based on the features of the objects.

The map representation tessellates the area into free space:

Each numbered box is a cell of free space.

##### Fixed Cell Decomposition
This is also known as the graph paper approach. features a plotted on a 2D array:

* Empty cells represent space where the robot can navigate.
* Filled cells represent obstacles.

If the cell size is too large, then objects can merge.

##### Adaptive Cell Decomposition
Each rectangle bounding a free space is only recursively decomposed if some obstacle lies within it:

* This continues until some predefined resolution is reaches.

This results in:

* Larger cells where there is free space.
* Smaller cells around obstacles.
