## Digital Images

> Discrete representation of spatial and intensity values in a 2D matrix. 

Raw images are often:

* Extremely noisy
* Contain invisible bands of the EM spectrum. 
* Contain too much information (that needs to be cropped out)

## Image Sensing & Optics
Images are a signal so it is collected using a sensor.

1. Light is **reflected** off, or **emitted** by, objects.
1. Photos pass through the optics.
1. Photos are **focussed** onto the **focal plane**.
	* Electronically or chemically.
1. The energy of photos is importance when forming images.

Not all images are in the visible spectrum so we can use other wavelengths, ultrasonic and so on to create images.

### Attenuation

### IR Cameras
They are good when there isn't a large amount of ambient light.

There are three different types of IR:

**Near IR** 0.7um - 2um
: Little thermal emission, but can use laser illumination.

**Mid-wave Infrared** 3um - 5um
: Good for hot objects as there is less background thermal emission.

**Long-Wave Infrared** 8um - 14um
: Good for room temperature (thermal LWIR emission peaks at 300K)

## Low Light
Visible band cameras only work well when there is ambient light.

This means they are not good at night.

To correct for this we can use an **amplifier**:

* This introduces a lot of noise.
* Tends to make the camera sensitive to glare.

## Tools for Digital Image Processing

* MATLAB (licensed)
	* Through image processing toolbox.
* ImageJ (free)
* OpenCV (free)

**Pre-Processing:**

* Basic Correction
* Basic Noise Removal
* Background Removal
* Alignment
* Format Changing
* Transformation

**Main Processing:**

* Advanced Correction
* Advanced Noise removal
* Segmentation
* Detection
* Searching
* Feature Extraction
* Recognition

**Post Processing:**

* Image Formation
* Format Changing
* Result Representation
* Report Generation

You will gain significantly better results if you pre-process.
