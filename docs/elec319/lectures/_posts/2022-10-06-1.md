## Binary Images

* Simplest type of images
* Each pixel can either be black or white

The size of the image is:

$$
M\times N\text{ bits}
$$

where $M$ and $N$ are the rows and columns.

A histogram for a 1 bit image only has two peaks for dark and light.

## Grayscale Images

* Generally 8 bits per pixel
	* This gives 256 levels of brightness.
	
## Colour Images

* Each channel RGB has 8 bits.
	* This gives 24 bits per pixel.

You can generate histograms for each channel or sum the channels to account for all of them.

### Colour Quantisation
You can't represent an infinite number of colours using 24 bits. As a result the raw colour is quantised to fit in the colour space.

We can use the following algorithms to add dithering to account for quantisation:

* Uniform
* Median-cut
* Octree
* Popularity
* Generalised Lloyd 

## Conversion
### Colour Image to Grayscale Conversion
This can be achieved by converting each RGB pixel to greyscale by forming a **weighted sum**:

$$
a_1R+a_2G+a_3B
$$

MatLab's `rgb2gray` uses $a_1 = 0.2989$, $a_2=0.5870$ and $a_3=0.1140$.

### Grayscale to Binary Image Conversion
To convert from grayscale to binary we need a **threshold value**.

Thresholding is an easy way to:

* Convert grayscale to binary.
* Separate foreground from background.

There are two levels of thresholding:

* Histogram
* Multi-level Thresholding
