Morphology is concerned with the shape of structures.

## Morphological Erosion

The final image is a subset ($\subseteq$) of the original image.

Allows objects to shrink and separates objects & regions.

It is a pixel-by-pixel operation, sliding the structuring element (SE) at every pixel:

1. If the origin of the SE coincides with a 0 (background pixel) of the image:
	* There is no change, move the the next pixel.
1. If th origin of the SE coincides with 1 (foreground pixel):
	* Perform an `AND` operation on all the pixels within the SE.

Pixel-by-pixel operations are very slow.

Erosion is expressed by the set operation:

$$
A\ominus B
$$

where:

* $A$ - The source image.
* $B$ - The structuring element.

This is good for getting rid of **salt noise** (white spots) on images.

## Morphological Dilation

This is the opposite of erosion, allowing objects to expand.

It is a pixel-by-pixel operation, sliding the structuring element (SE) at every pixel:

1. If the origin of the SE coincides with a 0 (background pixel) of the image:
	* There is no change, move the the next pixel.
1. If th origin of the SE coincides with 1 (foreground pixel):
	* Perform an `OR` operation on all the pixels within the SE.
	
This results in the maximum output of the local region of the structuring element.

Dilation is expressed by the set operation:

$$
A\oplus B
$$

This is good for getting rid of **pepper noise** ()
