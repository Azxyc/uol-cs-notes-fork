Morphology is concerned with the shape of structures.

## Morphological Erosion

The final image is a subset ($\subseteq$) of the original image.

Allows objects to shrink and separates objects & regions.

It is a pixel-by-pixel operation, sliding the structuring element (SE) at every pixel:

1. If the origin of the SE coincides with a 0 (background pixel) of the image:
	* There is no change, move the the next pixel.
1. If th origin of the SE coincides with 1 (foreground pixel):
	* Perform an `AND` operation on all the pixels within the SE.

Pixel-by-pixel operations are very slow.
{:.warning}

Erosion is expressed by the set operation:

$$
A\ominus B
$$

where:

* $A$ - The source image.
* $B$ - The structuring element.

This is good for getting rid of **salt noise** (white spots) on images.

## Morphological Dilation

This is the opposite of erosion, allowing objects to expand.

It is a pixel-by-pixel operation, sliding the structuring element (SE) at every pixel:

1. If the origin of the SE coincides with a 0 (background pixel) of the image:
	* There is no change, move the the next pixel.
1. If th origin of the SE coincides with 1 (foreground pixel):
	* Perform an `OR` operation on all the pixels within the SE.
	
This results in the maximum output of the local region of the structuring element.

Dilation is expressed by the set operation:

$$
A\oplus B
$$

This is good for getting rid of **pepper noise**.

## Other Morphological Operations
### Morphological Opening
This is erosion followed by dilation with the same structuring element:

$$
A\circ B = (A\ominus B)\oplus B
$$

This smooths contours and removes noise.

### Morphological Closing
Dilation followed by erosion with the smae structuring element:

$$
A\bullet B = (A\oplus B)\ominus B
$$

Joins nearby connected components together.


### Morphological Boundary Extraction
We can get the boundary of an object by:

1. Eroding with a suitable SE.
1. Subtract this form the original image.

$$
\beta(A) = A-A\ominus B=A-(A\ominus B)
$$

### Extracting Connected Components
Extraction of connected components can be performed using morphological operation as an iterative procedure. 

1. Let $x_k$ denote the set of connected foreground pixels at the $k^{\text{th}}$ iteration.
1. Start the procedure at one of the connected foreground pixels $x_0$.
	* $x_0$  is known as the seed.
1. Dilate this pixel: $x_0\oplus B$
1. To stop this dilation becoming connected to pixels which are not part of this component, perform a logical AND with the image:
	
	$$
	(x_0\oplus B)\cap A
	$$
1. Use the resulting output as the seed for the next iteration.
1. Repeat this until no more extractions can be made.

This can be expressed in the following steps:

1. Do for $k=\{1,\ldots\}$:
	
	$$
	x_k(x_{k-1}\oplus B)\cap A
	$$
1. Until:
	
	$$
	x_k=x_{k-1}
	$$

### Region Filling
This closes holes in objects. It consists of the following steps:


1. Set:

	$$
	x_0=1, x_x\oplus B
	$$
1. Do for $k=\{1,\ldots\}$:
	
	$$
	x_k=(x_{k-1})\cap \bar A
	$$
1. Until:
	
	$$
	x_k = x_{k-1}
	$$

### Hit-and-Miss Transform
This searches for images the structuring component in an image. It is given by:

$$
A\otimes B=(A\ominus B_1)\cap(\bar A\ominus B_2)
$$

Where we have two structuring elements:

$$
B_1\cap B_2=\emptyset
$$

### Skeletonisation
This is the process for reducing foreground regions in a binary image to a skeletal remnant.

Let $A$ be an image and $B$ be a structuring element.

Let $(A\ominus kB)$ denote $k$ successive erosions of $A$ using $B$.

The the skeleton of an image $A$ is:

$$
S(A)=\bigcup^K_{k=0}\left\{(A\ominus kB)-(A\ominus kB)\circ B\right\}
$$

* $K$ is the maximum number of iterations before the image is eroded to nothing.

### Top-Hat
The difference between the image $I$ and the opened version of the image $I$:

$$
T(I)=I\hat\circ s=I-I\circ s
$$

This returns object of an image that are:

* Smaller than the SE
* Brighter than their surroundings.

This highlights peaks.

### Bottom-Hat
The difference between the closed version of the image and the image $I$:

$$
B(I) = I\hat\bullet s=I\bullet s-I
$$

Returns objects of an image that are:

* Smaller than the SE
* Darker than their surrounding.

This highlights valleys.
