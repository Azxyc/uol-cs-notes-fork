Segmentation is the separating of objects from the background. It **divides images** into **regions**.

## Edges & Regions
**Edge enhancement** can divide images into regions:

* Each region is bounded by an edge.

A **threshold** can detect edges in an edge enhanced image.

### Edge Linking
Due to noise, edges may be unclear:

* Edges may not be continuous.
* Regions may not be self-contained.

We use **edge linking** to solve these issues. To link up "loose ends" in an image we can use:

* Linking nearest neighbours.
* Linking all within a given distance.
* Probabilistic linking.

#### "Snakes"
Snakes is an advanced edge-linking or region extraction algorithm:

* Uses defined edges and a cost-minimisation technique to find regions.
* The cost function is minimised when the edges match the underlying features.
* The optimisation can be done using any standard algorithm.

## Thresholding
Some objects are **not large enough** to generate detectable edges (such as a small house in an image of a large valley).

A simple method for segmentation is to use multiple thresholds:

* To select a certain band of grey levels.
* The pixels in a **region** will often have a similar intensity.

### Variance Growth
A problem with thresholding is with variance in light within an image. An automated method to threshold an image is by using **variance growth**:

* Images often contain large regions with similar intensities.
* Objects of interest are typically have a different brightness to their background.

We want to choose a threshold on the flat part of the histogram.

## Statistical Texture
We can use a kernel to define the neighbourhood of a pixel. These pixels are connected to the central pixel:

If you take the mean of the kernel:

* Pixels in the same region will tend towards the central pixel.

## Watershed Algorithm


1. Represent the image as a surface (with height defined by pixel intensity).
1. Applying a thresholding "flood-fill":
	* Link connected pixels to form the background.
1. Repeat this to form several regions as layers.

## Colour Segmentation

We can start by representing the image in HSL:

* We can then threshold on the hue or saturation channels to find the object.

## Motion Segmentation
We can separate moving objects from stationary backgrounds:

* Take the difference between the two images to clearly identify the object.

We can remove small camera motions and noise by using noise filtering on the output.

## Region Labelling
After segmentation, region labelling is required. The result of image segmentation is a binary image with the foreground represented by ones.

Typically there will be a large number of foreground regions, this contains:

* Objects of Interest
* Background Regions
* Localised Noise
	
	This can be removed by using noise filtering.

To distinguish the regions we label connected foreground pixels. We use:

* Connected Component Labelling
* Extracting Connected Components

## Noise in Segmentation
By knowing the type of noise (white, Gaussian, photon) we can use an appropriate model to remove it effectively.

Blur is also a form of noise. To deal with this we change change our blur model to account for blur caused by the sensor.
