# Lecture 6-1
## List Ranges
A list range lets us write a long list in a compact way:

```haskell
> [1..10]
> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
```

If the start is bigger than the end then you will get an empty list. This means you can't count down in a list in this way. Using `..` also works with letters to fill in the letters in between.

To give a step size give the first two elements and then a number to stop before or on:

```haskell
> [3,6..20]
> [3,6,8,12,15,18]
```

To count backwards use the a step size of `-1`:

```haskell
> [5,4..2]
> [5,4,3,2]
```

### Infinite Lists & Functions
* You can also use this notation to define an infinite list: 

	```haskell
	> [1..]
	> [1,2,3,4,5...
	```

	This will last forever and you can pass then on to functions. This may be useful if you want some number of elements in an infinite list `take 3 [1..]`.

* To make a list of an an infinitely long value you can use `repeat`.
	
	```haskell
	> repeat 'a'
	```
	
* To make a list of an infinite cycle you can use the `cycle` function.

	```haskell
	> cycle "abc"
	```

## Exercises
1. ```haskell
	onetox x = [1 .. x]
	```
	
1. ```haskell
	evensupto x = [0, 2 .. x]
	```
	
1. ```haskell
	countdown x = [x, x - 1 .. 0]
	```
